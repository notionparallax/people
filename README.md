I'm Digitising Jonathan Glover's book, _What Sort of People  Should There Be?_

I really enjoyed this book when I read it about 8 years ago. I wanted to read it again but it's out of print.

This is an attempt to make it into an electronic version, eventually into an eBook. You can read it on a small screen quite hapily, or add it to a reader like Pocket. If you look at it on a big screen it'll break the text up into pages and put the scanned page that the text came from next to the HTML text.

All the content is in `_includes/` and then it's own file (named in an obvious way).

If you spot a spot an error then submit an issue or a pull request. If it's a small thing then you can do it through the GitHub interface, no need to download the code.
