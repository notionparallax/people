            <p>Attitudes have varied all the way from the view that the interests of future generations should largely override those of people now alive, to the opposite opinion that we need give future people no consideration at all. In the days of Stalin, part of the propaganda for his activities appealed to the future. It was said that the horrors imposed by his rule on that generation of Russians were justified by huge benefits to later generations. The supposed causal connections linking extermination and terror with the future benefits were only apparent to the eyes of the faithful. So that defence of Stalin is rightly discredited. And, rather as a proper revulsion against Nazism has often spilled over into hostility to all policies of eugenics or euthanasia, so the reaction against Stalinism has led to scepticism about any sacrifices for future generations. These doubts were given their most forceful expression, long before Stalin. by Alexander Herzen:</p>
            <p>If progress is the end. for whom are we working? Who is this Moloch who, as the toilers approach him. instead of rewarding them, only recedes. and as a consolation to the exhausted, doomed multitudes crying 'morituri te salutant'. can give back only the mocking answer that after their death all will be beautiful on earth. Do you truly wish to condemn all human beings alive today to the sad role of caryatids supporting a floor for others some day to dance on&hellip; or of wretched galley slaves. up to their knees in mud. dragging a barge filled with some mysterious treasure and with the humble words 'progress in the future' inscribed on its bows? Those who are exhausted fall in their tracks; other s with fresh forces take up the ropes; but there remains, as you said yourself, as much ahead as there was at the beginning, because progress is infinite. This alone should serve as a warning to people: an end that is infinitely remote is not an end, but, if you like. a trap&hellip; ' The view that the interests of present people should always count for less than those of future people has little attraction. It is unfair: why should our lives and happiness matter Jess, just because we live now rather than in two hundred years' time? It involves an absurd degree of confidence in our predictions: how do we know what the world will be like in a few generations' time, or what people then will want? Applied in every generation, it has the danger of the paradox which Herzen pointed out. that if every generation makes the sacrifices, the benefits are deferred for ever. So, quite apart from Stalinist associations, policies of heroic self-sacrifice by present people are open to obvious criticism. But, where people have a normal amount of selfishness, heroic self-sacrifice is likely to have little support. It would be perverse to make the weaknesses of that policy the centre of discussion. In practice, decisions are more likely to reflect the view that future generations have little or no claim on us. The serious debate is between that view and some alternative more plausible than endlessly repeated self-sacrifice. One such alternative gives equal weight to people's interests, whichever generation they belong to.</p>

            <h3 id="the-equality-principle">2 The Equality Principle</h3>
            <p>This principle that people's interests should be given equal weight, regardless of their generation, is a rejection of one kind of dis1. Prom the Other Shore. translated by Moura Budbcrg. Oxford. 1979. pp. 36-7. like many others, I first came across Hcrun's ideas through the writings ofbjs distinguished modem follower Isaiah Berlin.</p>
            <p>crimination, of one way of departing from impartiality. The belief that people should be given equal consideration, or should be treated equally unless there is some relevant difference between them, has been argued for by various thinkers in different ways. It is sometimes said that this impartiality is built into either the concept of morality or the concept of justice.</p>
            <p>One such argument is found in the writings of R. M. Hare,• who claims that universalizability is a logical feature of moral judgements: if I believe that you ought (morally) to give away half your income, I am logically committed to holding that anyone else in relevantly similar circumstances ought to do the same thing. Hare argues that this property of moral beliefs generates an impartial utilitarian morality, in which everyone's interests are given equal weight. In deciding what we ought to do, we have to place ourselves in turn in the position of everyone affected by the different courses of action, whichever generation they belong to.</p>
            <p>A rather similar conclusion is reached by John Rawls,' who appeals to the concept of justice. In his well-known theoretical model, the impartiality required by justice is secured by working out the terms of the contract which would be agreed between self-interested and rational people ignorant of which position in society they are to occupy. Rawls applies his model to the case of justice between generations by stipulating that the people making the contract all belong to the same generation, but do not know which one it is. He thinks this procedure would generate a 'just savings principle', and says, 'We can now see that persons in different generations have duties and obligations to one another just as contemporaries do. The present generation cannot do as it pleases but is bound by the principles that would be chosen in the original position to define justice between persons at different moments of time. •• Both Hare and Rawls derive their conclusions from more general theories that are controversial. Hare's theory depends on linguistic intuitions about the meanings of words used in making moral judgements. Some of Hare's critics disagree with his clajms about moral language. Others disagree with his derivation of impartial utilitarianism from the universallzability of moral judgements. And others say that, if the use of moral 2. Prudom and Reason. Oxford. 1963.</p>

            <p>language commits us to utilitarianism, they will abandon it and use non-moral terms to express their non-utilitarian values. There is scepticism about an argument ruling out all systems of values but one, and whose authority ultimately rests at least in part on claims about the meanings of words. •</p>
            <p>Rawls bases his theory on claims about what he calls 'reflective equilibrium': a state where our theoretical views and our intuitive responses to particular cases have been adjusted to each other in such a way that they form a stable system. Our intuitive beliefs about what is just are in part to be corrected by the results of the theoretical model. But the terms of the 'original position' in which the rational contractors reach their agreement are also adjusted to bring the results close to our intuitive ideas of justice. As the contractors all belong to the same generation, there seems no reason why their agreement should include any provision for future generations. Previous generations will already either have saved or not saved for them. Either way, it is not in their interest to put anything by for future people. Rawls sees this difficulty. To give the intuitively correct result, be alters the original position by adding ties of sentiment between successive generations. But it is not clear how much saving this ad hoc device would generate. Some critics of Rawls reject the whole model of the original position. Others think that, to deal with this issue, It needs to be altered more drastically, perhaps by including members of every generation among the contractors. But this interpretation has problems of its own. The policies the contractors agree on for conserving or depleting resources may determine how many generations there are. And there is something elusive about a contract agreed by a group whose composition depends on what the contract says. 6 Perhaps not every generation need be represented. It might be enough for contractors to be from different generations, but not know which they belonged to.</p>
            <p>The general theories of Hare and Rawls raise too many issues to pursue here. And the equality principle can be supported by reasons which do not require any such theoretical superstructure. 5. Hare discusses thls last objection In Moral Thinking, Its u~/3. Method and Point, Oxford1981.p. 151f.</p>
            <p>6. These comments on Rawls derive from Brian Barry. 'Justice between Generations', In P. M. Hacker and J. Rnz (eds.): law, Morallly and Society. Oxford. 1977: and from 0. Clayton Hubln: 'Justice and l'uture Generations', Philosophy and Public Affairs 1976.</p>
            <p>One line of thought makes a direct appeal to our intuitive responses, without requiring any complex theory. An imagined bus journey is used by R. and V. Routley to shed tight on some of the issues in the nuclear power debate. 7</p>
            <p>The bus carries both passengers and freight on its long journey. It is always crowded. but passengers keep getting on and off, and the drivers change. so that quite different people are on board at different stages of the journey. Early in the journey, a container of highly toxic and explosive gas is put aboard, destined for somewhere near the end of the route. The container is very thin, and the consigner knows it is unlikely to survive the journey intact. If it breaks, some of the passengers will probably be killed. Sending the container of gas on the bus seems an appalling act. The consigner might make various excuses. It is not certain the gas will escape. If it does, perhaps the bus will have crashed and killed everyone first. Or perhaps the passengers on the bus at the other end of the journey will be people of a different type who do not mind being killed. He further tries to justify his act by pleading economic necessity: his business will crash unless he sends the container on the bus. The Routleys plausibly claim that none of this adds up to a good defence of the consigner's action. Their intended parallel with the nuclear waste problem we are leaving for future generations does not need spelling out.</p>
            <p>There is one defence of the consigner's act whose serious use is almost unimaginable. This is that the harm done does not matter at all, simply because it is done to people who are not on the bus at the time the container is put aboard. Nobody would suppose that getting on at a later stop rather than an earlier one deprived people of any claim to consideration. It may be replied that all the people who get on at later stops are now alive, and so have a claim on us in a way future generations do not. But the supposed importance of this distinction is hard to believe in. Suppose the journey was very long, taking the bus several years, and that the passengers killed by the gas were young children born after consignment. Would this make the act perfectly acceptable?</p>
            <p>[t may be said that these children have lives overlapping with us. Because we will have relationships with them, they have a claim on our 7. In the best discussion known to me of practical issues involving future generations. "Nuclear Energy and Obligations to the Puture'. Inquiry 1978.</p>
            <p>concern. This argument, if accepted, suggests that. while we must not harm the children of those now alive, we could quite legitimately leave a time bomb which would kill or maim some of their children. Or. if we do not want our own children to be upset. we could leave the bomb, not for their children, but at least for their grandchildren or great-grandchildren. To make this point is not merely to use a slippery slope argument, to show the difficulty of drawing the boundaries this kind of view requires. Many perfectly defensible views require boundaries with some element of arbitrariness. The time-bomb case is designed to suggest that the attempt to draw boundaries is mistaken in principle. It is terrible if people are killed or maimed. Whether the bomb was set before the date of their birth, or how long before, is quite irrelevant to our condemnation of the act. Our response suggests that people's moral claims are not reduced by when they live, any more than they are by where they live. And that is the equality principle.</p>

        <div class="point" epub:type="subchapter">
            <h3 id="some-views-incompatible-with-the-equality-principle">3 Some Views Incompatible with the Equality Principle</h3>
            <p>There are several influential attitudes to ethics which clash with the equality principle. One is contractarianism. Another is what is sometimes called the 'person-affecting' view. And another is a cluster of approaches which limit claims on us to people with whom we feel natural sympathy or identification.</p>
            <p>Contractarianism is a powerful analysis of morality. When our moral thinking reaches the adult stage, and claims about right and wrong are no longer based on appeals to authority. whether parental or religious, there is a problem about what they are based on. And there is a prior problem of explaining what they can mean. Contractarlanism answers both these problems by saying that we invent right and wrong. • We have a common interest in keeping society afloat. and moral rules, resulting from tacit agreements, serve this function. There is an empirical version of contractarianism. which says that this is how the moral rules of various societies did in fact develop. And there is a rational version, which says that, however existing moral codes are to be explained, the only defensible moral principles are those that would be agreed by people 8. cf. J. L. Mackie: Ethics: lnvtntlng Right and Wrong. llannondsworth. 1976.</p>
            <p>striking self-interested bargains with each other. The rational version claims not only to make morality intelligible, but also to explain how we can have a motive for being moral.</p>
            <p>A disturbing feature of contractarianism is the way it ties people's moral claims to their bargaining power. Those with weak powers of retaliation may find they are in no position to do the deals which would give them rights and other claims. Old people may be given rights because most of us will one day be old. so we are likely to see such rights as being in our long-term interest. But foetuses. young children and the handicapped have no bargaining power with the rest of us. We have passed the stage of being foetuses or young children, and perhaps the chances of being handicapped are too small to weigh with us in selfinterested bargaining. And none of these groups has any threats to bargain with. Aborted foetuses do not retaliate. (T am not here arguing that abortion is wrong. Good reasons can be given for a very liberal position on abortion. 9 What I am arguing is that it is unsatisfactory to say that foetuses have no moral claims because we can kill them without fear of retaliation. This approach removes moral prohibitions that protect those who are weak and have little bargaining power. Losers will include foetuses. babies, children. minorities, animals. the poor. the handicapped, and perhaps women. 10 )</p>
            <p>This feature of contractarianism applies strikingly to future generations. We can affect them , but they cannot affect us. So they have no bargaining power on which to hase a contract giving them moral claims. So. on the contractarian view. they have none. Those of us who accept the equality principle think that this issue brings out a deficiency in contractarianism. A tough-minded contractarian might prefer to argue that the equality principle is based on some kind of illusion or error. But he will have to say the same about all those values which are not generated by self-interested bargaining. An explanation of our values loses plausibility. at least as a complete account, when it ends up having to explain so many of them away.</p>
            <p>A second approach which conflicts with the equality principle is the 9. cf. Michael Tooley: 'Abortion and infanticide', Philosophy and Public Affalr-3 1972. I 0. This objection to contractananlsm does not apply to the version developed by Rawls. where those striking the self-interested bargain arc ignorant or whether or not they belong to one or more or these vulnerable groups. But we hove seen that this version has problems ortts own in dealing with future generations.</p>
            <p>view that all moral beliefs should take a 'person-affecting' form. Impersonal principles may tell us to promote health or happiness. or to eliminate poverty, war or unhappiness. But 'person-affecting' principles tell us to make people healthier or happier. or to rescue people from being poor. being victims of war, or being unhappy. On the personaffecting view. an action is only right or wrong where there are people who are better or worse off than they would have been on some alternative.</p>
            <p>At first sight, the distinction may seem purely scholastic. How can we promote health without making people healthier? In most contexts this response is right. But in some cases there is a big difference. And the issue of future generations is such a case. As Derek Parfit has pointed out, 11 different social policies lead to different people being born. Many of us have parents or grandparents who would not have met but for a world war, or but for a decision to build a university or college somewhere. And it is likely that opting for one economic policy or energy policy rather than another will largely or entirely change the composition of a future generation in a country. If so. it will not be possible to say of the members of that generation that they -are better or worse off than they would have been had the other policy been chosen. For. had it been chosen. they would not have been.</p>
            <p>Person-affecting principles seem attractive. They express our sense that people are the centre of value. And impersonal principles convey an air of treating people merely as means to the production of abstract entities such as Health or Happiness. They also seem to have disturbing consequences avoided by person-affecting principles. If our principle is 'maximize happiness', one way of doing this is to create extra people who will be happy. Those repelled by this may prefer the personaffecting principle 'make people happy', which does not have this implication.</p>
            <p>But it is a feature of any moral system containing only personaffecting principles that such a system gives generations beyond the immediate future little or no claim on our concern. There will probably 11. 'Puturc Generations: Purthcr Problems'. Philosophy and Public Affairs 1982. My discussion or person-affecting views derives from Porfit"s ideas. Person-affecting views ore advocated by Jan Narveson: 'UUIItorlanlsm and New Generations', Mind 196 7, and in bls book Morality and UUlity, Baltimore, 1967. pp. 46-50. They arc also defended in an lniA:rcsllng unpublished paper by Frlc Rakowski: 'Obligations to Actual and Potential Persons'. </p>
            <p>be no people in distant generations who would exist whichever policy we choose. Where there are no people able to claim they are better or worse off than they would have been, we are considering generations which purely person-affecting systems give no moral claim on us. As with contractarianism, there is a direct conflict with the equality principle. The supporter of such a system will reject the equality principle. And those of us against killing even our remote descendants will find purely personaffecting systems inadequate.</p>
            <p>A third approach which conflicts with the equality principle stresses that moral claims are rooted in our natural responses and in our ability to identify with other people. If we had no capacity to feel sympathy with others. or none of the imagination needed to see things from their point of view, it is hard to see how we could be motivated by anything except our own narrowly self-interested desires. Morality influences us because of its roots in our emotional life. Some of these emotional reactions may be explained by the evolutionary usefulness of the behaviour they promote, while some may have their origin in the social conditioning which helps hold human communities together. But, whatever the balance of genetic and environmental factors in a particular case, the importance of these responses in motivating altruism is hard to deny.</p>
            <p>The suggestion is that we do not have any natural feelings of affection or concern for people living in two hundred years' time. And, because we do not identify with them, we have no reason for being motivated by consideration of their interests.</p>
            <p>We can accept that our emotional responses play a key role in the development of our moral beliefs. We do not have to accept the supposed consequence that our values can never go beyond these natural responses. It is possible for thought to cast doubt on some of the moral boundaries which come naturally to us. We care more about a friend injured in a car crash than about thousands of people killed or injured in an earthquake at the other end of the world. But we may not trust this difference of response as a good guide to what should be done. And this applies equally to our relative lack of identification with people living in the future. Our lack of concern seems caused by our limited imagination: the bias towards here and now. When we think critically, we realize that distant people (in place or time) would evoke our concern if we could meet them. So our indifference can be seen as a kind of illusion of perspective: a limitation we should try to overcome. It may have been harmless in the Stone Age, but now we often have to take decisions affecting people remote from us. And it is not obvious that our intuitive feelings of distance are a better guide to action than the equality principle.</p>

            <h3 id="practical-constraints-on-the-equality-principle">4 Practical Constraints on the Equality Principle</h3>
            <p>There are obvious practical constraints. We often have a falr idea of the likely effects of our actions on people now alive. But our confidence goes down steeply when we are thinking instead about our impact on the lives of people in two hundred years' time. We may decide to use genetic engineering to raise their I Q, only for it to turn out that this set of intellectual skills is largely irrelevant to dealing with their problems. Or we may conserve fossil fuels without anticipating scientific advances making them unnecessary. Or, alternatively, what we leave our descendants may be the cause of quarrels and wars wwch would otherwise be avoided. The limits of practical predictability need no empbasis. These limits do not only apply to predicting the long-term consequences of what we do. They also apply to predictions about the tastes and values of future people. We may be a bit sceptical about how far people in the eighteenth century could have anticipated what things we find desirable. But, with the possibility of genetic and neurobiological technologies being applied, we have reason for being even more doubtful about how far the outlook of our descendants in two hundred years will be like ours.</p>
            <p>It is possible to exaggerate these limits to prediction. The Routleys have warned of this:</p>
            <p>We do have excellent reason to believe, especially if we consider 3,000 years of history, that what people there are in a hundred years are likely to have material and psychic needs not entirely unlike our own. that they will need a healthy biosphere for a good life; that like us they will not be immune from radiation; that their welfare will not be enhanced by a high incidence of cancer or genetic defects, by the destruction of resources, or the elimination from the face of the earth of that wonderful variety of non-human life which at present makes it such a rich and interesting place. 11</p>
            <p>12. op. cit .. p. I 54.</p>
            <p>The Routleys here make a strong case for the view that we have good reason to avoid inflicting on future generations things that we now would regard as a disaster. The claim that our descendants might not mind any nuclear radiation. cancer or genetic defects resulting from our nuclear waste policy does sound like the kind of feeble excuse given for sending the container of gas by bus.</p>
            <p>When considering our powers of prediction it seems plausible to say two things. Our views on how to give our descendants a good life may be roughly right, but are very likely to be wildly wrong. Our views on what would bring disaster to our descendants may be wrong, but are very likely to be roughly right. IT these two points are correct, it seems that the equality principle has strong implications for the issue of nuclear waste, but weaker implications for attempts to enhance the lives of future generations.</p>

        <div class="point" epub:type="subchapter">
            <h3 id="against-utopias">5 Against Utopias</h3>
            <p>Future generations are unlikely to share all our values. One obvious consequence of this is that we should not plan utopias for them. Utopian planning, even when intended for the immediate future, has been much criticized. Utopias are always tidy and boring. They renect the imaginative llmits of their creators. One critic has said that 'no utopia has ever been described in which any sane man would on any conditions consent to live, if he could possibly escape'. 11 And the drawbacks are even clearer when we think of plans aimed at several generations ahead. John Mackie, arguing once in a discussion against some optimism of mine. said that if the Victorians had been able to use genetic engineering, they would have aimed to make us more pious and patriotic.</p>
            <p>So. while we should be concerned to avoid harm to future generations, we should avoid utopian designs for their lives. We need to remember the limitations of our own outlook. This is a reason for valuing what Karl Popper, in his criticisms of utopianism, called the 'open society': 13. Alexander Gray: The Socialist Tradition, New York, 1968. quoted in Robert Nozick: Anarchy, State and Utopia, New York, 1974. Support for Alexander Gray's view can be found in P. B. Manuel: Uwplas and Uwplan Thousht, Boston. 1966. </p>

            <h3 id="in-defence-of-intervention">6 In Defence of Intervention</h3>
            <p>The drawbacks of utopianism are familiar and obvious. But it is often too readily thought that these drawbacks show the truth of the negative view: that we should limit our planned influence on future generations to the avoidance of disasters for them. (A narrow version of this view is that our sole concern should be that we do not cause such disasters: we must not be the people who leave the container of gas on the bus. A broader version says that we should also. where possible, help future generations avoid disasters not of our maklng.)</p>
            <p>This negative view of our concern for the future closely resembles what Karl Popper has called 'piecemeal social engineering'. 14 lie says. The politician who adopts this method may or may not have a blueprint of society before his mind. he may or may not hope that mankind will one day realize an ideal state, and achieve happiness and perfection on earth. But he will be aware that perfection. If at all attainable. is far distant. and that every generation of men. and therefore also the living. have a claim; perhaps not so much a claim to be made happy. for there are no institutional means of making a man happy. but a claim not to be made unhappy. where it can be avoided. They have a claim to be given all possible help if they suffer. The piecemeal engineer will. accordingly, adopt the method of searching for. and fighting against. the greatest and most urgent evils of society, rather than searching for. and fighting for. its greatest ultimate good. This difference is far from being merely verbal. In fact, it is most important it is the difference between a reasonable method of improving the lot of man, and a method which. If really tried. may easily lead to an intolerable 1</p>
            <p>increase in human suffering.</p>
            <p>Popper's version of the negative view is the broad one: be allows that people have 'a claim not to be made unhappy' and 'a claim to be given all possible help if they suffer'. His position relies heavily on two contrasts, neither of them completely sharp. The first is where utopian plans (large scale, detailed and rigid) are contrasted with the smaller, more flexible measures that count as 'piecemeal engineering'. And there is the contrast between eliminating an evil and promoting a good. Each of these contrasts 14. K. R. Popper: The Open Society and its Enemies, fifth Edition. London, 1966. p. 158.</p>
            <p>is a matter of degree. rather than being marked by any clearly determined boundary. (Is a campaign for better schools the promotion of a good. or the elimination of a cluster of evils. such as ignorance and illiteracy?) But. even without sharp boundaries. we are able to understand the two dimensions indicated. and Popper's preference in each case for measures towards one end of the continuum rather than the other. The difficulty is the extent to which the case for the negative view depends on treating the two contrasts as one. Popper's arguments for the negative view draw on the defects of utopianism: perfection is at best distant, and there are no institutional means of making people happy. (This last point about the absence of institutional means of increasing happiness might be questioned. Even if true it would be no argument against the possibility of using genetic engineering or brain technology to make people happier.) When we distinguish between the two contrasts. we need not accept Popper's alternatives: either utopianism or only negative intervention. In bringing up children. we may hope to encourage their talents. or their curiosity and imagination. in ways we hope will enrich their lives. without trying to realize some blueprint of the ideal life for them. It needs to be argued, rather than just assumed. that the same kind of non-utopian but positive policy is impossible at the social level. If genetic engineering or other techniques can be used to produce future generations who transcend our limitations, whether physical. intellectual or emotional. the case against utnpiaoism need not rule this out. For. as argued earlier about genetic engineering. there need be no plan for an ideal type of person drawn up by some committee. And we can recognize that our great-grandchildren will live by their values rather than ours. without as a result wishing to confine them within our own genetic limitations.</p>

            <p>If the argument of this chapter is right, people of future generations have in principle claims on our concern just as great as people now alive. Where the avoidance of disaster for them depends on what we do. this should have the same weight as if the disaster were to people now. Our restricted ability to make accurate long-term predictions. together with the probability of changes of outlook. set limits to programmes designed to confer positive benefits on future people, but some positive programmes of this kind may be worth attempting. As biotechnology increases our power to influence what people are like, different positive programmes may become possible. And where we can choose between them, there may be a conflict between two underlying aims. We could be guided by the aim of making future people happy, perhaps by making sure that their preferences and the kind of world they inhabit are as closely matched as possible. Or we could be concerned to give them the widest possible freedom of choice between different kinds of life. These two aims should now be looked at.</p>

        <h2 id="adjustment"><em>Chapter 12</em> Adjustment</h2>
        <p>The problem is to design a world which will be liked not by people as they now are but by those who live in it. 'I wouldn't like it' is the complaint of the individualist who puts forth Ws own susceptibilities to reinforcement as established values. A world that would be liked by contemporary people would perpetuate the status quo. It would be liked because people have been taught to like it, and for reasons which do not always bear scrutiny. A better world will be liked by those who live in it because it has been designed with an eye to what is, or can be, most reinforcing.</p>
        <p>B. F. Skinner: Beyond Freedom and Dignity</p>
        <p>Out of the crooked timber of humanity no straight thing was ever made. Immanuel Kant</p>
        <p>If we have effective techniques both of behaviour control and of genetic engineering, some will be tempted to put them together to make future generations happier. One form of this temptation is the utopian plan of harmonizing desires and the world. B. F. Skinner says the problem is to design a world that will be liked by those who live in it. The utopian plan goes one stage further. It adjusts both the world and people's desires until they are in harmony. (Skinner's own aim involves adjusting people too, as a large part of the 'world' we like or dislike is other people.) Two suggestions made here go against all this. We should not plan utopias because future people will not share our outlook. And the use of conditioning, drugs or brain stimulation in the utopian plan would deprive us of control over the sort of people we are. Our project of selfcreation would be destroyed.</p>
        <p>Genetic engineering allows a possible response to both these criticisms. The objection to utopianism is met by designing not only utopia but also people who will like it. And the objection to external moulding of our desires and behaviour is met by designing people who place no value on self-creation. Combining genetic and environmental technology (the Brave New World strategy) in this way generates a kind of defence of the utopian project.</p>
        <p>Many of us feel a strong resistance to this strategy of utopian adjustment. It arouses in extreme form the opposition we now feel to 'personnel management' and other present types of manipulation. We have the thought that, while social harmony may be desirable. it is better to take people as they are than mould them to fit. We should adjust society to people rather than people to society. But this thought is vague. When looked at more closely, it turns out to have several distinct components. One strand of thought is resistance to the idea of changing human nature at all: a form of conservatism which has been rejected here. Another reason for opposition depends on beliefs about the quality of different kinds of life. And a further line of thought is that autonomy and selfcreation have a kind of importance not recognized in the utopian's reply about designing people who do not care about them.</p>
        <div class="point" epub:type="subchapter">
            <h3 id="quality-and-the-satisfaction-of-desires">1 Quality and the Satisfaction of Desires</h3>
            <p>We do not have to accept some general principle of conservatism about human nature in order to resist the utopian plan of adjustment. Our objection may be different. Suppose we are offered a future in which self-creation and the value placed on it are wiped out. (Perhaps we are offered Brave New World or the life of Sisyphus Mark Three.) We may opt for having fewer of our desires satisfied rather than accept such a loss of quality. This ties in with more general doubts about treating the satisfaction of desires as the only ultimate social goal. We are very adaptable. Even without biotechnology, we adjust to adverse or dreary circumstances, often by revising downwards our hopes, and by making our desires 'realistic'. This psychological adaptability, which is so useful and even admirable, carries with it the danger that we will settle for a world far less good than we could have. Contentment is not enough. The danger is that social decisions will be guided by a one-dimensional utilitarianism. On this version, the aim of increasing happiness is interpreted either as increasing the number of satisfied desires, or as reducing the number of unsatisfied ones. (The difference between these two versions becomes important when technology makes it easy to create or eliminate desires.) What makes this version one-dimensional is that desires are considered in isolation, without regard to the person's attitude towards them, or the role they play in his or her life. The importance of desires is simply a function of their strength. One-dimensional utilitarianism seems to give no grounds for resisting a world of people like Sisyphus Mark Three. [t seems to have no argument against any version of utopian adjustment, other than contingent and precarious claims about practical obstacles. ft is a strength of utilitarianism that the value of states of affairs is not thought to derive from some mysterious source external to ourselves. For utilitarians, the value of anything depends on its relation to the experiences or desires of conscious beings. Unhappiness and the frustration of desires are to be accepted only where there is a sufficiently compensating benefit to someone. In the absence of conflict with anyone else's interests, the fact that someone wants something is a good reason for his having it. Some of us. although attracted by this linking of value with people's interests, will yet find inadequate any view which offers only practical objections to all schemes of utopian adjustment. We will be pulled both ways when we consider utilitarianism.</p>
            <p>If we continue to reject one-dimensional utilitarianism, we have two options. The first is to identify utilitarianism with the one-dimensional version, and to reject it in favour of a pluralist approach to value. This pluralism has been eloquently advocated by Isaiah Berlin: The world that we encounter in ordinary experience is one in which we are faced with choices between ends equally ultimate, and claims equally absolute, the realisation of some of which must inevitably involve the sacrifice of others&hellip; It seems to me that the belief that some single formula can in principle be found whereby all the diverse ends of men can be harmoniously realized is demonstrably false. If, as I believe, the ends of men are many, and not all of them are in principle compatible with each other, then the possibility of conflict - and of tragedy - can never wholly be eliminated from human life. either personal or social. The necessity of choosing between absolute claims is then an inescapable characteristic of the human condition. <span class="footnote-anchor"></span><span class="footnote">1. 'Two Concepts of liberty' (1958). reprinted in Pour Essays on liberty, Oxford, 1969. pp. 168-9. See also Bernard Willlams: 'Conllictsofvalues·. in Moral Luck, Cambridge. 1981: James Griffin: 'Are There incommensurable Values?', Philosophy and Public Affairs 1977: Charles Taylor: 'The Diversity of Goods'. In Amartya Sen and Bernard Willams: Utilitarianism and Beyond, Cambridge, 1982.</span></p>
            <p>The second option is to consider whether a more sophisticated version of utilitarianism will enable us to resist utopian adjustment while preserving the link between value and interests. To do this we need a more complex picture of people's interests than the one-dimensional utilitarian has. This will take account of such things as our concern for autonomy and self-creation. And it will be necessary to recognize that desires do not just vary in intensity, but also vary in the role they play in our lives. We have attitudes towards our desires, and sometimes would not exchange the satisfaction of one for any amount of satisfaction of another. {I like talking to people and I like espresso coffee. But I like talking to people so much more, that no amount of espresso coffee would compensate for having to forgo conversations with some of the people I know. And the elimination of the liking for coffee does not seem a worrying prospect, while I would do a lot to resist any elimination of my pleasure in talking to friends.)</p>
            <p>A version of utilitarianism which took adequate account of these psychological complications would not support the obliteration of all desires which could not be satisfied. It could resist the slide to utopian adjustment. In taking account of these other dimensions of our psychology, it would come close to some versions of pluralism. It might be argued that the one-dimensional utilitarian has been unfairly treated here, and that he too can take account of the psychological complications. His view is that the satisfaction of any desire is good. but that the importance of satisfying desires varies with their strength. He could argue that the reason why autonomy and self-creation are important is that we mind about them so much. The desire to be a person of a certain kind, even one with some unsatisfied desires, may be a very strong one, and so be given great prominence by the one-dimensional utilitarian.</p>
            <p>This reply has obvious force. But there are grounds for unease about it. Suppose I am in the power of some behaviour controller, who tells me that he is going to turn me into Sisyphus Mark Three. I reply that this goes against my strongest desire. which is to be a person with powers of self-creation denied to all versions of Sisyphus. But the behaviour controller replies that my future desire to roll stones can be made much more intense than my present desire for self-creation. Where the future desire is stronger than my present desire to be a particular kind of person, and where the future desire is also at least as likely to be satisfied, it is not clear that the one-dimensional utilitarian has any remaining argument against the change.</p>
            <p>Many philosophers are sure they know what utilitarianism is. and easily take sides for and against it. But if we find the one-dimensional version inadequate, there is the problem of seeing where the boundary comes between pluralism and more complex kinds of utilitarianism. For the complex utilitarian, there is the problem of defining a stable position. which does not collapse. on one side into the one-dimensional version. or on the other side into something not recognizably utilitarian at all. For the pluralist. there is the problem that. if he admits that his various goods are valuable because we care about them. he has to give an account of caring about things that does not collapse into desiring things. [f valuing things is not ultimately different from desiring them. pluralism is in danger of collapsing into complex utilitarianism.</p>
            <p>Until the boundary between pluralism and complex utilitarianism is more clearly indicated. those of us in that region may often be unsure on which side of it we are. (And, since there can be different forms of complex utilitarianism. we may be on different sides of the boundary with respect to different versions.) Many of the most interesting disagreements cut across the lines between utilitarians and their opponents. In thinking about biotechnology, complex utilitarians may have more in common with some pluralists than with one-dimensional utilitarians. And what they have in common is something important to defend: the belief that quality often should not be sacrificed to contentment.</p>

        <div class="point" epub:type="subchapter">
            <h3 id="autonomy">2 Autonomy</h3>
            <p>Another objection to utopian adjustment is on grounds of autonomy. We value being free to decide for ourselves what we are to be like, and what sort of life we will lead. U someone else plans my desires, little room is left for this. Autonomy has been mentioned as an objection to behaviour control, and seems a possible objection to genetic engineering. It might be said that the genetic supermarket is objectionable on grounds of autonomy. Those who oppose attempts by the state to impose a particular outlook on citizens are often also unsympathetic to parents who try to impose an outlook on their children. Although even the most liberal usually accept that some actions are so harmful to others that parental discouragement or state legislation are necessary. belief in the value of autonomy requires either kind of intervention to be justified. The onus of argument is on government or parents to show that the harm avoided or the good done is enough to justify the intervention to mould behaviour or character. A system where marriages are arranged by parents may, on grounds of autonomy. be just as objectionable as a system where governments order people to take particular jobs. Parents valuing autonomy will not have some blueprint for their children. The aim will be for the children to decide largely for themselves what sort of people they are to be.</p>
            <p>It may seem a -natural extrapolation from such attitudes to object that the genetic supermarket gives parents too much power over the lives of their children. But the extrapolation is less justified than it may seem. One complication here is that those who bring up children unavoidably have a great influence on them. Even if parents intervene as little as possible, or intervene in ways that make the children react against them, their decisions still affect the nature of the children. (This is not to speculate about how important, relative to genetic factors, or to other environmental ones, parental influences are. The claim is the modest one that different parental policies have different results.) So parents acting on a belief in autonomy would be unrealistic if they aimed not to influence what their children were like. A more plausible view stresses parental encouragement of autonomy: children being encouraged increasingly to take their own decisions as they grow older. This opposition to people being stifled by being denied choices, or by having their choices overridden, does not depend on the fiction that upbringing has no causal influence.</p>
            <p>On this more plausible view. it is acceptable for parents to encourage children to have some desires rather than others. (The acceptability varies according to the desires involved and the means used.) It is also acceptable for parents to encourage children to develop abilities and skills, although perhaps not for them to discourage the development of others. Applying this to positive genetic engineering, the restrictions generated fall a long way short of a total ban. It is objectionable for parents to choose genes with a view to impairing or eliminating abilities: say, choosing to have children who are unable to read. But it is acceptable, on this view, to increase children's abilities, and to opt for them to have one set of desires rather than another. Reducing their abilities may prevent them from taking decisions or acting on them, while increasing their abilities does not. And autonomy is not violated if we use genetic engineering to give people at the start of life a tendency to have a particular set of desires. This is not dilterent in principle from doing the same thing by education or other environmental influences. It is another way in which parents affect the way their children turn out. But it does not override their autonomy. That would require overriding their desires or decisions. At the stage of being genetically engineered, the people or potential people in question have no desires and have taken no decisions. There are complications here over whether altering desires is quite separate from altering abilities. There are further complications about whether it is possible to increase some abilities without diminishing others. But these complications are problems of parenthood in general, and are not peculiar to genetic engineering. If we feel roughly clear about the distinction between environmental influences which violate autonomy and those that do not, the same line between different genetic influences seems no less clear. And ruling out all parental choice of their children's genes is not a consequence of any plausible view about autonomy.</p>
            <p>But the autonomy objection does have force against behaviour control, which takes away our ability to shape our own lives. It was argued earlier that this is not just an objection based on the inequality between controllers and others, but applies also to mutual control through a democratically programmed machine. Once our lives are under way, and we have views about how we want them to go, we do not want to be altered according to some external plan, however impersonally devised. The utopian's reply is that he will design people who do not mind about this objection. But this reply, if accepted, has the alarming property of silencing any objection to anything. We make slavery acceptable by designing people who like being slaves. If we value being in control of our own lives, and find the utopian reply inadequate. we cannot appeal to the frustration and despair caused by lack of autonomy. The utopian has eliminated those drawbacks. We have to say that the value of having an autonomous and self-creating life is independent of them. Autonomy ls not of value merely as a means to contentment.</p>
            <p>Appeals to autonomy, although of importance here, are not adequate as a complete response to utopian adjustment. It may be tempting, when we bold that autonomy has a value independent of its contribution to contentment, to think that we can eliminate the need for controversial claims about quality of life, and cite autonomy as the sole and decisive objection to utopian adjustment. But this is implausible. Belief in autonomy tells us that people's desires and choices should be respected, but it is silent about influencing which desires people have. Nothing is said about some patterns of desires, with their associated kinds of life, being better or worse than others. Like one-dimensional utilitarianism, belief in autonomy gives us no objection in principle to creating only people who Live like Sisyphus Mark Three.</p>
            <p>Belief in autonomy usually takes one of two forms. The first version. sometimes known as libertarianism, involves absolute prohibitions on various kinds of interference in people's Lives. The idea is often stated in terms of rights: people have the right to take certain decisions for themselves, and to live their lives in their own way. These rights function as side constraints, limiting what others may do in pursuit of their own personal or social goals. The second version treats autonomy as something which should be maximized, rather than as an absolute constraint on what people can do to each other. The difference comes out over the question of whether people should be free to do things which will severely restrict their own future freedom of action. (Examples are taking a highly addictive drug, becoming a nun, selling yourself into slavery, signing up for a long period in the army.) On the Libertarian view, no one should prevent anyone doing any of these things. Preventive interference would be a prohibited violation of autonomy. But on the maximising view, there could be a case for intervention. A breach of autonomy now could secure greater autonomy later.</p>
            <p>Neither of these versions on its own provides a satisfactory response to utopian adjustment. The Libertarian view seems not to rule out any genetic engineering. We could choose to have children who were genetically predisposed to disorders involving pain or mental deficiency. Because we would not be overriding anyone's current preference or decision, Libertarianism has nothing to say. A modified version of Libertarianism could perhaps escape this by appealing to some broader theory of rights, some of which might be violated by such genetic engineering. But in doing so, Libertarianism moves away from appealing to autonomy. and becomes indeterminate until the rights are specified. The maximizing version of autonomy is almost equally unsatisfactory when taken on its own. It rules out giving a child a genetic disorder involving pain, but only to the extent that pain impairs freedom of action. It rules out genetically engineering mental deficiency on the same basis. But it does not rule out engineering Sisyphus Mark Three, as his narrow life comes from his narrow desires rather than from any limits of his autonomy. Although, in this context at least, the maximizing version is an improvement on libertarianism, neither version is adequate as a full account of what is wrong with utopian adjustment. The objection on grounds of autonomy is a powerful one, and is not met by the utopian's proposal to design people who do not care about autonomy. But it supplements, rather than replaces, the objection about loss of quality.</p>

            <h3 id="neutrality">3 Neutrality</h3>
            <p>Another possible argument against utopian adjustment is based on a particular version of liberalism. This view is characterized by the belief that governments should be neutral between different conceptions of the good life<span class="footnote-anchor"></span><span class="footnote">2. See Ronald Dworkin: 'Ubcralism'. In Stuart Hampshire (ed.): Public and Private Morality, Cambridge, 1978. and Bruce A. Ackerman, Social Justice In Liberal State. New Haven. 1980.</span> The belief that, other things being equal, we should try to avoid an official government view on what sort of people there should be, was used earlier to argue for many genetic-engineering decisions being decentralized. Subject to certain restrictions, the genetic supermarket may be a better system than having a central policy. It is likely, though not certain, that the genetic supermarket would lead to great variety, and to 'experiments in living' which contribute to the growth of human consciousness. The importance of autonomy, the desirability of experiments in living, and certain views about treating people as equals. all contribute to the case for governmental neutrality between different versions of the good life. But it is implausible to treat this neutrality as an absolute principle, never to be overridden. There is some departure from neutrality when the genetic supermarket is restricted to prevent parents giving their children what most of us think are serious handicaps. Some of us are pleased that the state departs from neutrality to subsidize education and the arts. We may feel that similar departures from neutrality in genetic policy should not be ruled out absolutely.</p>
            <p>The case for neutrality between versions of the good life is sometimes held to apply, not just to governments, but to anyone with power over others. Bruce Ackerman has applied this view to parental choice in the genetic supermarket.' He argues that parents have no right to use the power given by genetic engineering to mould their offspring in one way rather than another. He thinks that such decisions by any power-holders, whether governments or parents, are objectionable departures from neutrality. His solution is a genetic lottery. from which are excluded only those characteristics that would be considered disadvantageous by every member of the generation already in existence. Ackerman is clearly correct that severe restrictions on genetic engineering follow from the principle that power-holders should never depart from neutrality. What is less clear is that we should choose to accept these restrictions rather than abandon this sweeping version of the neutrality principle. Some doubts about the principle concern its implications for the quality of life. (This is unsurprising. These considerations. in so far as they are the least controversial, are precisely what the principle aims to exclude.) It raises an obstacle to public support either for the arts or for schools which teach more than those minimal skills which would gain unanimous support in an educational referendum. And. in the case of Ackerman's genetic lottery, it only needs one person who thinks that suffering is ennobling for otherwise unnecessary genetic disorders to be included to blight the lives of future people. Accepting that there is a case for neutrality does not commit us to being neutral at all costs.</p>

            <h3 id="the-human-zoo">4 The Human Zoo</h3>
            <p>The utopian project offers the tempting possibility of a world where all desires are satisfied. This option, especially when contrasted with our present world, is not easily dismissed. But it conflicts with an alternative aim: that of creating a world with the widest possible choice between different kinds of life. The second aim also appeals to values with a deep hold on us: our enthusiasm for human variety, and our related commitment to autonomy and self-creation. Fortunately,<span class="footnote-anchor"></span><span class="footnote" data-num="3">3. op. cit.. <em>chapter 4</em>.</span> these aims are in partial harmony. Because many of our deepest desires are bound up with autonomy and self-creation, we are more likely to be satisfied in a world where many alternatives are open. But, with the possibility of creating new types of people. the two aims may come apart. Utopian adjustment may then lead to kinds of behaviour control which go against our belief in autonomy.</p>
            <p>But autonomy is not the whole case against utopian adjustment. Por. as we have seen. Sisyphus Mark Three does not lack autonomy. U he stops wanting to roll stones, his decision to do something else will not be frustrated. What is wrong with his life has to do with the narrow range of his desires. He may even have a project of self-creation, but one narrowly centred on developing the abilities needed for increasingly stupendous feats of stone-rolling.</p>
            <p>Imagine a world, produced by utopian adjusters. which took account of the desirability of autonomy and variety. In one place is Sisyphus, contentedly. and of his own choice, rolling stones. Nearby is someone else. hopping about in complicated patterns. There are thousands of such people. They are spending their lives building towers out of marzipan, writing articles about meaning. knitting huge maps of the moon. They are all autonomous, contented and different. Call this world the Human Zoo. Those of us doubtful about the quality of life there have an objection which is not reducible to questions of autonomy and variety. The problem is whether this objection about quality can be defended against Skinner's criticism that it is just a prejudice. How far should it be dismissed as the product of biases generated by our present genes and conditioning?</p>

            <blockquote>The upshot of these considerations is that justice as fairness is not at the mercy, so to speak, of existing wants and interests.

        <p>Part of the case for thinking systematically about kinds of life as a whole is that piecemeal decisions may bring about a world much less good than we could create. And there are some aims, attractive in themselves, whose exclusive pursuit can lead to a world less good than is possible. We have seen that one-dimensional utilitarianism does not rule out ways of life with unacceptably low quality. And the simple Libertarianism which says we should be concerned only with autonomy or liberty is inadequate for a similar reason. Of two worlds with equal liberty, and reached by an equally libertarian route, one could be much worse than the other.</p>
        <p>But all these opinions about the quality of different kinds of life raise obvious questions. What is 'quality', and how can judgements of this kind be supported? Is there some Archimedian point, from which the kinds of life in different social systems can be assessed, in the way John Rawls thinks there is for assessing their justice? Or do our views simply reflect the biases of our own genetic nature and our own kind of society?</p>

            <h3 id="external-perspectives">1 External Perspectives</h3>
            <p>In the discussion of the simple experience machine, the distinction was drawn between internal and external perspectives. From the internal perspective, life on the experience machine is very satisfactory. But, from our external perspective, we may find it unattractive. And we, with our values and outlook, have to decide about plugging into the machine. The same contrast arises when we consider the contented version of Sisyphus or the other people in the Human Zoo. From the internal perspective such lives are fine, but from our external perspective we may think them utterly futile.</p>
            <p>Some philosophers think that these contrasting views from the different perspectives should trouble us more than they do. They suggest that the metaphor of perspectives is available only to those who think that there is some objectively true answer to these questions. David Wiggins, in the context of discussing the contrast between lives that have some meaning and lives that are futile, has made a case for this. He says,</p>
            <blockquote>All the different perspectives of a single array of objects are perfectly consistent with one another. Given a set of perspectives. we can recover, if only they be reliably collected. a unified true account of the shape, spatial relations, and relative dimensions of the objects in the array. If we forget these platitudes then we may think it Is much more harmless than it really is that the so-called outer and inner perspectives should straightforwardly contradict one another. But there is nothing whatever in the idea of a perspective to license this scandalous idea - no more than the truism that two perspectives may include or exclude different aspects will create the licence to think that the participant and external views, as the non-cognitivist has described them, may unproblematically conflict over whether a certain concern is objectively worth while or not.</blockquote><span class="footnote-anchor"></span><span class="footnote">1. 'Truth. Invention and the Meaning of life'. <cite>Proceedings of the British Academy</cite> 1976. p. 351. This stimulating. impenetrable and original lecture is relevant to the questions discussed here. Although it deals with very abstract issues. It is written with an intense and scandalized passion, sometimes reminiscent or P. H. Bradley.</span>
            <p>This is to take the metaphor of perspective rather too seriously. What the metaphor expresses can be stated in terms of beliefs. Some beliefs distort or omit objective facts. A person unaware that he is on the experience machine may believe that François Mitterrand is showing him a less messy way of eating spaghetti. His belief is just false. But other questions of belief may be different. We may disagree with Sisyphus, thinking that his life is less worthwhile than ours. Yet neither we nor Sisyphus need think we are reporting on different aspects of some objective state of affairs. So it may be wrong to say the conflict is over whether a certain concern is objectively worth while or not. And where we are dealing with different commitments and concerns, rather than with unproblematic questions of fact, the idea of conflict between opinions is not such a scandalous one.</p>
            <p>Let us call a way of life that seems satisfactory from the internal perspective 'internally adequate'. Where someone finds a kind of life internally adequate. he prefers it to any alternatives of which he is aware. And he finds it worthwhile in itself. (This last feature is meant to exclude the possibility of the test of internal adequacy being satisfied by a very grim life which is preferred to the only alternatives, which are even worse.) And the point about preference brings out the way internal adequacy is relative to alternatives.</p>
            <p>Because ways of life can themselves involve filtering information or moulding people's preferences, we are unlikely to find internal adequacy a sufficient justification for choosing to create a particular kind of world. The experience machine is internally adequate, but we can see losses unknown to the person on the machine. Sisyphus. or an inhabitant of Brave New World, may know everything we know, but the shaping of his desires makes for satisfaction with a way of life we find futile. This is not to say that internal adequacy is of no relevance to justifying a state of affairs. Where there are two worlds, similar in other respects, but one is found satisfying by its inhabitants while the other is not. obviously the internally adequate one has a large point in its favour. But if we resist the view that Brave New World, or the life of a supremely contented Sisyphus, cannot be surpassed, we have to hold that other considerations are relevant, as well as internal adequacy.</p>

            <h3 id="quality">2 Quality</h3>
            <p>In our present world, the limitations of internal adequacy are illustrated by certain kinds of severe mental handicap. Some people with these handicaps have lives which, as far as we can tell, are internally adequate. Such a person may seem very content, having only a few simple and mild desires, which he easily satisfies. And he may have no conception of any different kind of life. Although his life may well be worth living, most of us think it sad that he is so limited by his handicap. Once again, contentment is not enough. We think it better to have a life with some intense desires, and to have a wider range of them, even if a lower proportion can be satisfied ('better to have loved and lost&hellip;'). </p>
            <p>Should we say that quality is just a matter of the intensity and range of experiences and desires? Consider a machine which gives you thousands of different experiences, each generating a corresponding desire which is then satisfied. It is called the Horror Machine. It starts by banging your head against a wall, so that you have an intense desire for this to stop, which it then satisfies. Next it plunges you under water, giving you an intense desire to surface before you drown, which it then satisfies. Now, it starts to attach electrodes to various parts of your body&hellip;</p>
            <p>The whole encounter with the Horror Machine is one we would wish to escape from. The range and the intensity of desires are only two of the dimensions that are relevant. Another dimension is our attitude to them. New desires and their satisfaction only enrich life where we are glad to have them. And, with desires we already have, the importance we place on them or their objects is similarly relevant to assessing their contribution to our lives. I may like many of the satisfactions that are available on the simple experience machine, but still think that no amount of them would outweigh losing control over my own life, or losing contact with the real world. There can in this way be a kind of lexical ordering of desires or of aspects of life: a set of priorities perhaps only elicited by hypothetical choices between giving up this aspect or that. It is well known that John Stuart Mill proposed a test for assessing the quality of different pleasures. He said:</p>
            <blockquote>Of two pleasures, if there is one to which all or almost all who have experience or both give a decided preference. irrespective of any obligation to prefer it. that is the more desirable pleasure. If one of the two is. by those who are competently acquainted with both. placed so far above the other that they prefer it, even though knowing it to be attended with a greater amount or discontent, and would not resign it for any quantity or other pleasure which their nature is capable of, we are justified in ascribing to the preferred enjoyment a superiority in quality, so far outweighing quantity as to render it, in comparison, of small account.<span class="footnote-anchor"></span><span class="footnote">2.</p>
                <p>J. S. Mill: Utilitarianism (1861), <em>chapter 2</em>.</span> It is also well known that Mill's test has been criticized. What counts as being competently acquainted with two pleasures? I enjoy reading people's accounts of their lives. Suppose I read Proust's novel about his life. but much prefer the more straightforward autobiography of Lord Home: 'more facts to the page, and a healthier kind of life'. Proustians may object that I have not fully appreciated Proust, and so am not competently acquainted with both pleasures. But there is a danger of circularity: that only those making the 'right' choice count as competent. And there is also a problem about what counts as a 'decided preference'. It cannot just be a matter of the number of times one pleasure is chosen over another. Take the pleasure of reading the classics of philosophy. Imagine a house party consisting of people selected for their credentials as judges of this pleasure (perhaps Sir Alfred Ayer, Sir Peter Strawson, Sir Stuart Hampshire, Sir Karl Popper and Sir Isaiah Berlin). The host (perhaps Lord Quinton) has thoughtfully left in the bookshelves such works as Hume's Treatise, the Critique of Pure Reason, Spinoza's Ethics, Logik der Porschung, and My Past and Thoughts. But perhaps, at the end of the house party, these books will hardly have been looked at. The most popular reading, after the Good Food Guide and some back numbers of Country Life, may turn out to have been John Le Carre, P. G. Wodehouse, and a book called How to Develop a Super Power Memory. Even if this pattern of choice prevailed for years rather than just for one house party, it would not follow that the pleasures of P. G. Wodehouse are 'more desirable' than those of Spinoza.</p>
                <p>But Mill's test need not be interpreted as one of totting up favourable choices. When he says of the competent judges of the more desirable pleasure that they 'would not resign it for any quantity of the other pleasure which their nature is capable of', he may not be thinking of choices on particular occasions but rather of the kind of lexical ordering already mentioned. The distinguished philosophers chose Wodehouse more often than Spinoza but, perhaps, if they had to give up one totally, they would keep Spinoza. If so, reading the classics of philosophy passes the more plausible version of Mill's test (call this the 'elimination test'). Even on this version of the test, there may not be unanimity. One of the eminent philosophers, asked to make the decision after spending the house party reading Wodehouse, may make the 'wrong' choice, on the grounds that Spinoza gives him the pip. So long as only a small minority make the 'wrong' choice, Mill's test is satisfied, as he wisely does not require total unanimity.</p>
                <p>Mill's elimination test will obviously often fail to give a simple 'yes' or 'no' to a question about whether one pleasure is of greater quality than another. There will often be questions of interpretation, both of how large a majority is required and of what the non-circular tests of </p>
                <p>competence are.<span class="footnote-anchor"></span><span class="footnote">3. The problems are discussed by Vinit Haksar. In
                    <cite>Equality. Liberty and Perfectionism</cite>. Oxford, 1979. chapter II.</span> We are clearly not dealing with a simple and conclusive criterion, but with an account of what evidence makes it more or less plausible to say that one pleasure is of higher quality than another. (And we may want to complicate the picture further by allowing that there are different dimensions of quality to assess. A person who would give up P. G. Wodehouse rather than Hume may still feel that the fact he more often reads Wodehouse reflects something about the quality of Wodehouse, and so it may be a mistake to concentrate entirely on the elimination test, to the exclusion of considering other evidence from the general pattern of choice.)</p>
                <p>When we interpret the elimination test, not as a simple criterion of quality, but as one central source of evidence in support of claims about quality, it is an attractive proposal. If we are to make comparisons of quality at all, it is unsatisfactory not to be able to give supporting reasons. Any single test purporting to give precise and conclusive answers seems unlikely to persuade. But it is also perverse to treat as quite irrelevant the views of those who have experienced (and apparently appreciated) both pleasures. So, when Mill's test for quality is applied in a suitably modest and flexible way, the evidence it provides gives some basis for qualitative comparisons.</p>

            <p>If internal adequacy is not enough to show that a kind of world is one we should opt for, it is tempting to say that the choice should be decided by our attitudes, when we view different worlds from our external perspective. We prefer privacy to transparency, or the ordinary world to the dreamworld and so, however internally inadequate they might prove to be, we can reject these alternatives in favour of a world more Like our own. But this view looks like mere conservatism. unless we can give reasons for thinking that the changes would involve some loss of quality. And, when we try to give reasons, we are pulled towards something like Mill's elimination test. I we try to apply the test in these cases, our status as competent judges may be questioned, in view of our lack of any experience of the new world being considered. This brings out a more general limitation of the test when we use it to compare the quality, not of isolated pleasures. but of whole kinds of life. Consider a debate between supporters and opponents of a policy of modernizing a primitive country, lived in mainly by tribal farmers. In such debates, opponents of modernization (sometimes the farmers themselves. sometimes anthropologists) argue that the majority do not want their pattern of life disrupted. and would not choose to live in towns and work in factories. But on the other side it may be argued (perhaps by economists) that industrialization will provide resources for modern education and medicine, whose benefits the tribal people cannot now understand. The argument may be that. when they have fully experienced the benefits, they will be glad of the change.<span class="footnote-anchor"></span><span class="footnote">4. This line of argument has been criticized by Jon Elster. In
                    <cite>Ulysses and the Sirens</cite>, Cambridge, 1979, pp. 77-86, and he discusses arguments of this sort applied to the industrial Revolution in England In '
                    <cite>Sour Grapes - Utilitarianism and the Genesis of Wants</cite>'. In A. Sen and B. Williams:
                    <cite>Utilitarianism and Beyond</cite>, Cambridge. 1982.</span> Or, it may be argued that, even if those whose outlook has been moulded by tribal life will always hanker after it. their children will feel no regrets. Suppose the economists' stronger claim is true: that those who undergo the transition will prefer the industrialized state. They have experienced both states. and prefer the second. Does this mean that Mill's test is satisfied? There are grounds for doubt. Perhaps their judgement is biased. either by social pressures not to seem out of date or reactionary. or by a reluctance to admit mistakes. or by a tendency to make the best of things? This doubt applies equally if their preference is for their old tribal life. Their judgement may be biased by nostalgia. or by the tendency to think the grass is greener on the other side. This suggests that we require not only competent judges, but also controls against various kinds of bias. To compare life in Switzerland with life in Austria, it would be necessary to ask some who had emigrated one way and some who had gone the other way. Only if there were a solid majority for one country among both groups would we start to have evidence in support of the superiority of that way of life. (Even here we only start to have evidence, because of the possibility of other biases. Olaf Stapledon's 'mental malnutrition and poisoning' may be affecting us. Perhaps the newspapers and television in one country support the government, while in the other they oppose it. In the one, they pour out stories of optimism and cheer, while in the other they are filled with gloom and denigration.) </p>
            <p>Let us stipulate a version of Mill's elimination test which has built into it controls for bias produced by a person's present position. Call it the 'symmetry test'. Using this test, we have evidence that one state of affairs is qualitatively superior to another where those with experience of both prefer it to the other, whichever state they are in. The state of not having a headache would pass the test when compared with the state of having one. The problems of applying the test in less easy cases are serious. and so we will often (perhaps usually) obtain less than a clearcut answer. [n such cases, the test will function as an idealization. in the light of which we assess evidence of varying persuasiveness. Take the comparison between our own world and the world where our thoughts and feelings are transparent to others. In the ideal case, some of us make the shift to the transparent world, and at the same time a group brought up in the transparent world moves to our world. And. In this ideal case, the preferences are symmetrical: both groups overwhelmingly prefer the same world. In practice, the results are unlikely to be so clearcut. There are difficulties, both moral and practical, about carrying out the experiment of bringing up people with no privacy of mind. (The moral problems might be less serious if we had good reason to think their lives would not be made less good, but this is what the experiment is needed to establish.) Perhaps those making the transition to transparency would loathe it at first. but come decisively to prefer it. There is room for different interpretations here. Are they becoming better judges, as they leave embarrassment and inhibition behind? Or are the social pressures of transparency creating a conforming cheerfulness about their state? And if people from the transparent world think our world is worse, is this a powerful piece of evidence? Or should we say that, because of their upbringing, they have never learnt to appreciate the subtleties given to relationships by ambiguity and obliqueness? Where we compare two kinds of life, and find impressive evidence that one passes the symmetry test. we have a good reason for thinking it qualitatively superior to the other. And when we find evidence that our own preference for a way of life does not have the support of the symmetry test, we have grounds for wondering whether our attitude is the result of some bias.</p>
            <p>Take the case of the dreamworld. Suppose that, from our external perspective, we regard the limits of the dreamworld as claustrophobic, and have a decisive preference against any permanent move into it. But </p>
            <p>consider those who have entered an 'open' version of it, where they are not deceived about its nature and can remember our ordinary world. Suppose they do not share our attitude, but say they are overwhelmingly glad to have made the transition? The possibility is easier to imagine if we vary the example. Suppose we are told that our ordinary world is a dreamworld, causally dependent on some quite different state of affairs. Would we be desperate to leave the world we are used to, and to make contact with 'reality'? I would like to find out a bit more before deciding. ('You are one of thousands of humans standing packed together in a small battery, being reared for food on a Martian farm. Martian laws against cruelty to animals require the farmer to provide you with access to a dreamworld.') If things were very bad, I would stay here. Go back to the case where our world is the causally fundamental one, and where those who have entered the open dreamworld are glad to have done so. They understand our objections about claustrophobia and the lack of scientific research, as well as our doubts about dreamchildren. But. from their point of view, the advantages easily outweigh the drawbacks. And suppose that it is not easy to explain away their preference by citing factors that may bias their judgement. It is then reasonable to ask whether our resistance to the dreamworld is exaggerated, as a result of a conservative bias against what has not been experienced. At this point, we might be persuaded that our resistance to the dreamworld is the product of bias or unfamiliarity. This could result from our scrutinizing our own opposition more closely, perhaps with the help of 'reverse' examples, where our ordinary world turns out to be a dreamworld. Or people in the dreamworld (who have turned from it briefly to communicate with us) may persuade us that their choice is based on substantial advantages, by making an impressive case that their preference coexists with a thorough appreciation of our objections and doubts. If our opposition is undermined, we may ourselves decide to enter the dreamworld. Or, we may prefer to stay in the ordinary world, while accepting that this is the result of bias in favour of the familiar. But to accept this is to remove all serious objections to the view that the dreamworld may be better for our descendants. The supporters of the dreamworld, while not altering our choice, will have won the argument for the future.</p>
            <p>But our investigations may go the other way. We may think that we understand their case for the dreamworld at least as well as they understand our case against it, and that they are as likely as us to be biased. The fact that our preference does not pass the symmetry test raises the question of bias, but does not in itself establish that it is biased or irrational. There is more than one way in which a preference may fail to pass the test. In one kind of failure, the test gives a strong support to the alternative preference. (Someone who has never seen colour television may prefer to stay with black and white. But the symmetry test gives strong support to colour if almost all those who have experienced both prefer colour, whichever they now have, and if there is no evidence of biases affecting their judgements. TWs creates a presumption that the preference for black and white is itself the product of bias or lack of experience.) But other ways of not passing the symmetry test create no presumption about a preference. There may be no decisive view among those questioned in either of the two states. Or there may be asymmetry, where those in one state exhibit a clear preference, and those in the other have the opposite preference. In the case of asymmetry, neither preference passes the test. and so no presumption is created for or against either.</p>
            <p>The symmetry test resembles Hare's universalizability or Rawls's original position, in being a device which can be used to identify and correct the effects of bias. But the use of such devices presupposes that our values include commitment to some degree of impartiality. Someone with no such concern can say to Hare that he is not interested in making moral judgements, and can say to Rawls that he is not interested in justice. I am assuming here that we intend claims about the relative quality of different kinds of life to be more than expressions of any preferences we happen to have. These claims about quality may be empty if they are in no way linked to anyone's actual or hypothetical preferences. But some preferences and attitudes (not liking a kind of food you only tried when ill, liking some music because it reminds you of someone) seem so much the product of biasing circumstances that no claims about quality can plausibly be based on them. Someone with no such scruples will say confidently that any world he dislikes is of poor quality. The rest of us may be willing to detach judgements of quality from our own preferences where the evidence is that the symmetry test gives strong support to alternative preferences.</p>
            <p>But, even when we have a commitment to correct for bias, the symmetry test allows only a partial detachment from our own point of view. </p>
            <p>Its results are inconclusive in some cases. including all cases of asymmetry. And it cannot be applied where the comparison needed is not between person A in states X and Y. but between person A in state X with person Bin state Y. (Questions about genetic engineering may, often, be of this kind.) And the symmetry test will never tell decisively against states of affairs (such as Brave New World) where people's preferences are adjusted to favour their present position. So even apart from the extent to which the symmetry test is an idealization. its application has severe limitations.</p>
            <p>It may be thought that other tests could be devised for ranking worlds in order of quality. in ways that would not be subject to these limitations. But it seems at least equally likely that. when faced with many choices, even our most satisfactory tests would still be silent or inconclusive. If so, the reasons guiding these choices will have to appeal to our 'uncorrected' values and preferences.</p>

            <p>We may be glad that our own way of life is not restricted within limits set by medieval people. And we can see bow our descendants might find the limitations of our outlook equally cramping. For this reason, we might welcome the discovery of an Archimedian point, such that 'the long-range aim of society is settled in its main lines irrespective of the particular desires and needs of its present members'.</p>
            <p>In ethical writings. appeal is often made to 'moral intuitions': our varied responses of approval or disapproval of actions or states of affairs. Theories about what we should do are criticized on the grounds that they generate intuitively unacceptable decisions. In this book various possible theoretical approaches to the use of biotechnology have been rejected on the basis of intuitive unacceptability. But how sacred are these intuitions? On a favourable view, where intuition and theory conflict. theory has to give way. On a hostile view, intuitions are just a set of prejudices derived from a particular upbringing, and they should be discarded where they conflict with a well-grounded theory. The anti-intuitive view can be harnessed to various different theories. It may be claimed, as by R. M. Hare, that analysis of moral language gives an acceptability test for moral beliefs, independent of intuitions.</p>
            <p>Or it may be said that a contractarian account of morality is the external test. This view dismisses intuitions which do not have the backing of the actual or hypothetical contract.</p>
            <p>Strong versions of the anti-intuitive view are implausible. Its supporters normally propose theories that do accommodate many of our intuitive values. But a strong version leaves open the possibility that most, or even all, of our intuitive values might be incompatible with the favoured theory, and so have to be discarded. The theory would be the Archimedian point from which the whole world of values could be moved. But we could surely be justified in choosing to revise or bypass the theory. rather than change our whole attitude to life. (A person might say. 'Some things are more important than the terms of the hypothetical contract,' or, 'U that is the language of morals, then "morals" turns out not to be what I am interested in.')</p>
            <p>The Archimedian point from which our intuitions can be criticized seems to require viewing all our attitudes from an external perspective. But is making judgements from a perspective that excludes all our attitudes intelligible?</p>
            <p>The doubt about the intelligibility of this approach can be illustrated by one traditional proposal. Religious believers have thought that God's position is the Archimedian point. For them, there are the familiar difficulties of showing that God exists and showing that they know what God's views are. But there is the further problem of showing that He is not just one of Us. Why should God's opinions carry such weight? Because He made us as part of His plan? (Suppose a king and queen. rather disliking children, only have a baby to keep the royal line going. The prince grows up wanting to be a psychoanalyst. Suspecting the two jobs might be awkward to do together. he decides not to be a king. 'But you have got to accept the throne. Your being king was our only reason for having you.' 'Oh, I see. That makes all the difference.') What would count as showing that our values should be adjusted to fit God's? What does it mean to say that His are the 'correct' ones? Correct by what standards? And how are those standards validated? Perhaps the idea of judging from an Archimedian point external to our own concerns and commitments is unintelligible. This may seem to suggest that our attitudes cannot rationally be criticized or modified. But this is too brisk.</p>
            <p>The pro-intuitive view says that ethical theories have no basis other than intuitions. These theories are an attempt to give a coherent account of our values, which are only revealed by our responses to things. And theories must be controlled and corrected by these responses, in a way that resembles the relation between theory and observation in science. A strong version of the pro-intuitive view generates an extreme conservatism towards current attitudes. If theory has no power to modify our responses, it is reduced to cataloguing them. Philosophical thought about values becomes a matter of searching for the precise statement of what is already believed and felt. But this strong version is implausible in a way that can be brought out by taking up the parallel with science. It is a familiar point that a theory in science is not just a catalogue of observations. Observations modify theories, but theories modify our interpretation of observations. And where theories conflict with observational reports, we do not in all cases abandon the theory. We often have a range of options to consider, including attributing the observation to error or to some distorting factor not controlled for. Similarly. in thinking about values, it is not obvious that we should adopt the policy that intuitions are all to be taken as fixed points to which theories must be adjusted. One doubt about this is whether our unmodified intuitions are consistent with each other. Another problem is whether the 'moral intuitions' that have such authority are clearly marked off from other likes and dislikes which are not so sacrosanct. And, as we have seen, some of our values may be modified by evidence that they result from some bias.</p>
            <p>In epistemology and philosophy of science, few now deny the mutually modifying interaction of theory and observation. It is not plausible to treat all observational reports as sacred. Nor is it plausible to defend the 'Archimedian' approach of Descartes, who tried to combine scepticism about our whole system of beliefs with rebuilding the system from some external vantage point. Philosophers often express what is wrong with this, by quoting Neurath's image of science and philosophy: we are like a sailor who must rebuild his boat at sea. Perhaps each part must be rebuilt, but at each point enough of the boat must be left to keep it afloat. Neurath's image seems suitable for values too. 5 We do not just have a series of unrelated gut-reactions to things. If we have the degree of reflectiveness needed for a minimally coherent life, our attitudes display 5. I first heard it applied to values by Bernard Willlams in a discussion.</p>
            <p>some system of priorities. This system may be partly conscious and may, on examination. turn out to be in various ways limited or inconsistent. In rebuilding the system. we must always keep part of it afloat. But only a person of remarkable natural consistency (or remarkable natural selfconfidence) will be sure that no reconstruction is necessary. In taking decisions that will affect the lives of future people. we are bound to be guided by our values. U there is no Archimedian point. this is inevitable. But we will not just create people who repeat our outlook. This is because our values are open-ended. They include a belief in trying to transcend our own biases and limitations. They also include a belief in people creating themselves and so contributing to the unplanned development of consciousness.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>It has been suggested here that some things &mdash; self-development and self-expression, human contact, being part of the open-ended development of human consciousness &mdash; are of central importance to us. At least, this is so when we are sufficiently removed from misery to care what our lives add up to. But much of the misery in the world, which could be avoided, will not be eliminated in any of our lifetimes. To someone lacking food, clean water or medical care, or to someone facing torture or caught up in a war, concern with these more subtle values may seem frivolous. (Imagine a town where a flood makes most people homeless, and the few living on high ground go on discussing improvements to their own houses.)</p>
            <p>Yet the more urgent concerns do not make the other ones unimportant. People should be rescued, but it also matters what happens to them afterwards. In a world with so much avoidable disaster, it can seem frivolous to be a novelist or a musician, or to work on the foundations of mathematics or on the origins of the universe. It is right to reply that these activities are worthwhile in themselves. But another reply is also relevant. By such choices, people keep alive traditions more fragile than we often think. It has been argued that future generations have some claims on us. One such claim is that we should pass on these traditions. and not let 'the conversation of mankind" fade out. (It is not enough to rehouse those who lose their homes in the flood. if all that remains for them afterwards is life working in an insurance company.) It is hard to get the right balance between immediate and long-term problems. To ignore the urgent problems is to allow terrible things we could help to avoid. But it is not always wrong to give priority to the further future: at the time of a deadly epidemic, it may be right for some doctors to carry on with basic research. And to ignore the subtle values can be philistine and stilling. If we do ignore them, we may leave our descendants a world where the life of a contented consumer is the best any of them can expect.</p>
            <p>Perhaps positive genetic engineering in humans will be stopped by insurmountable practical barriers. Perhaps the same is true of the envisaged applications of neurobiology. And it may be found that much of our work is beyond the scope of any future machines. But we have now little reason for confidence in the existence of these technological barriers. It seems worth considering the transformation of human life these developments would bring. If we allow them to take place. people will not stay as they are. In deciding which changes to encourage and which to resist. we need some view about the strengths and weaknesses of our present nature. and some views about what makes for a better or worse life.</p>

                <h3 id="transcending-intellectual-limitations">1 Transcending Intellectual Limitations</h3>
                <p>A possible role for positive genetic engineering would be to raise our intellectual capacity. One day, perhaps remote from now, we may start to feel that we are coming up against the in-built limitations of our ability to understand the universe. The Kantian thought that our cognitive constitution may set limits to our grasp of the world is played down in some of the best modern discussions of Kant. But the thought may still be true. It is expressed in a remark I have seen ascribed to J. B. S. Haldane. </p>
                <p>that the universe may be 'not only queerer than we suppose. but queerer than we can suppose'.</p>
                <p>This line of thought is unfashionable because of its associations. In Kant. and in some of the nineteenth-century German metaphysicians who followed him. the stress on the limitations of our sensory and cognitive apparatus was accompanied by the view that we can never know the world as it really is: 'things in themselves' are in principle inaccessible to us, and the~ is no possibility of our being in a position to say anything about them. Such pessimistic metaphysics cannot easily survive awareness of progress in science. The limitations of our sensory apparatus are real, but we devise instruments to monitor what our unaided senses cannot detect. At any particular time, our scientific theories are imperfect and incomplete. But the fact of scientific progress cannot reasonably be denied. It is bard to see what this progress can be. if not the growth of an increasingly full and accurate understanding of what the world is like. So the realm of unknowable 'things in themselves' is one we are right to dispense with.</p>
                <p>But it does not follow from this that our unmodified intellectual equipment is the most that can be needed in extending our scientific understanding of the world. Just as calculus is too much for a dog's brain to grasp, so some parts of physics might turn out to be too difficult for us as we are. No doubt it would be hard to be sure that we were pressing against our limitations. But, faced with a continuing lack of progress on very baffling problems. we might come to suspect this. And we might have some thoughts on what changes in brain functioning could make a difference.</p>
                <p>To take this as a possible candidate for positive genetic engineering is not to make the widespread assumption that raising IQ is the obvious change to consider. The relevant intellectual limitations may require deeper changes than merely boosting the cluster of skills measured by IQ tests.</p>
                <p>Any programme of genetic engineering to modify our intellectual functioning would obviously have to be very cautious and experimental. But, once it showed signs of working without bad side-effects, it seems likely that some parents would choose to have children who would transcend our traditional limitations. Because our growing understanding of the world is so central a part of why it is good to be human, it would be very tempting for us to break through our genetic intellectual limitations. </p>
                <p>If we do have such limits, and do decide to transcend them, our descendants may be glad. To them, our decision might mean escape from a kind of claustrophobia. For the alternative would be to have an understanding of the world that was incomplete yet permanently static. And this kind of stifling is something the human race has not known since we first woke up and started to ask our questions.</p>

                <p>rt may be that we are still far from the limits of our intelligence. Primitive people have brains which, unknown to them, have unused capacity for mathematics and physics. We too may have a great deal of unused capacity. But other kinds of limitation are closer and more obvious. Our limited capacity for altruism, and for the imaginative sympathy it depends on. is one such case.</p>
                <p>In optimistic moments, we may hope that our history of cruelty and killing is part of a primitive past, to be left behind as civilization develops. But the events of our own century do not suggest that this process has gone far. We still know large-scale killing, sometimes of the inhabitants of entire cities in war, sometimes extermination of whole peoples as a deliberate policy. We are familiar with the effects of napalm, and not surprised by the daily use of torture in many parts of the world. Less dramatically, but with similar terrible effects, we are used to our own passivity in the face of so much hunger, disease and poverty. We know all about these things. Because of television. we know about them with more immediacy than was previously possible for those not directly involved. But there is a natural resistance to thinking in general terms about the human limitations these facts display. We switch off the television news and tum to something else. Or we compartmentalize our minds. rt is easy to think of each horror as a kind of isolated accident. Vietnam can be explained as due to a series of miscalculations, or Cambodia as the result of the lunacy of Pol Pot, or an Indian famine as the result of a flood or a crop failure. Or, in England, there is the thought that Hitler's policies were carried out by Germans, or Stalin's policies by Communists, neither of whom, of course, are at all like us. These are all shallow responses. Of course each particular disaster has its own causal explanation. But when they are considered together, It </p>
                <p>is bard not to see the limitations of human sympathy, and how easily it can be switched off. We acquiesce in avoidable misery. It is possible to speculate that many of us were born with the potential to become torturers, bombers or concentration camp guards. Most people realize other, more desirable potentialities. But there seems as little reason for confidence that. given the same history and circumstances as these people, we would not do the same things. (Lord of the Flies, William Golding's response to the Nazi episode, is partly about this.) This is not to say that we should respond to social and political disasters by resigned contemplation of our limitations. We need not accept that acting to make the world a better place is bound to fail. But such action does not have to depend on optimistic illusions about what we are like. Avoidable evils are not removed, partly because people unaffected do not care enough about them. Thousands of deaths in a faraway country do not stir us like one child run over down the road. Our sympathies are limited and local, with a few close people mattering more than everyone else in the world. This is not altogether bad. We need relationships involving special concern. So it would not be desirable to spread our emotional involvement evenly over the whole human race. But, even making allowances for this, it is bard not to feel that greater capacity for altruism and for concern at a distance would be an improvement. When we think of what we allow to happen, this is not easy to doubt. This line of thought may be reinforced by thinking again of the Darwinian explanation of how our genes came to be as they are. (Once again, no questions are being begged as to the relative importance of genes and environment. Darwinism explains our genetic nature, not our nature.) Our genes are what they are because they were better able to survive than others were. And, to the extent that we are the product of our genes, we are to be explained, in Richard Dawkins's vivid phrase, as survival machines for genes. And, unless we have a very crude form of evolutionary ethic. there is no reason why the qualities we value should exactly coincide with those which have led to gene survival. Perhaps, in terms of our values, the world would be a better place if people were more altruistic and generous than a perfectly calculated survival strategy for genes would make them. It is clear that Dawkins is himself attracted to this view. At the end of his book be says,
                    <q>'We can even discuss ways of deliberately cultivating and nurturing pure, disinterested altruism - something that has no place in nature, something that has never existed before in the whole history of the world. We are built as gene machines .. . but we have the power to turn against our creators. We, alone on earth. can rebel against the tyranny of the selfish replicators.</q><span class="footnote-anchor"></span><span class="footnote">1. The Selfish Gene. Oxford. 1976. p. 215.</span></p>
                <p>If our values favour more altruism than is now best suited to gene survival. we may. as Richard Dawkins suggests, take steps to cultivate it. But. on the Darwinian view, this seems to require either massive control over the environment or else genetic planning. For, in a natural environment. those with more altruism than is best for gene survival will by definition be less successful in propagating their genes than those with the optimal amount. They could be rescued from evolutionary oblivion by drastic social and environmental changes designed to give them a greater chance of survival. But it is hard to see what this would involve, or what other values would be sacrificed. U we cannot make these changes, or else decide the price is too high, the logic of the Darwinian theory is that any genes underlying a tendency to 'surplus' altruism are likely to be eliminated by natural selection. The only alternative would be genetic planning: direct intervention to make sure that the genes we value survive.</p>
                <p>Our emotional and imaginative limitations are especially apparent when we consider the psychology of war. We all know how here our technology has grown faster than we have. It is not clear that we will survive at all. Our arrangements for avoiding war are so flimsy, and we have not yet developed the sense of urgency appropriate to our precarious position. Nor have our attitudes sufficiently changed in the ways that would help survival.</p>
                <p>It may be that war is the product of particular social arrangements. which could be changed. Perhaps we can change our economic system or our approach to education, or abolish the nation state, without having to change deep aspects of our psychology. And perhaps these social changes will eliminate war. But, given our relative failure so far, we should at least consider the view that the abolition of war may need psychological changes which will not simply follow from political and social reform.</p>
                <p>Plausible contributory features of our nature are not bard to suggest. We have a tribal psychology well adapted to survival in the Stone Age. We have the desire to identify with a group; willingness to hate other </p>
                <p>groups; obedience; conformity; aggression: the responses to being part of a crowd; the responses to stirring music, and to uniforms, flags and other symbols: the love of adventure and risk: the need for a simple framework of ideas to make sense of the world; and the desire to believe rather than doubt. These aspects of our nature are not all entirely bad, and they may not contribute equally to war. Some of them may be more easily modified or controlled by social changes than others. But, taken together, they have contributed to the catastrophes we all know. And now they threaten the survival of our species. If either environmental or genetic methods are available, we may be wise to change ourselves if we can.</p>

                <h3 id="values-and-dangers">3 Values and Dangers</h3>
                <p>If we do decide to change ourselves, taking thought well in advance may help to ensure that the directions we take are guided by our values. The application of science to alter genes or brains may change the shape of human life. With so much at stake, we could not be justified in proceeding without clear aims. This does not imply that there has to be a single collective set of goals. As argued earlier, with genetic engineering there is a lot to be said for decentralized decisions realizing a diversity of aims, though subject to some restrictions.</p>
                <p>The value we place on diversity may conflict with the goal of eliminating the more harmful and dangerous side of our present nature. This conflict should not be slurred over. [t is likely to be a dominant political issue for the first generation to embark on positive genetic engineering. Whichever way that debate goes, the values guiding it will be those of the decision makers. The objectivity which consists in standing quite outside our own values does not exist. But, even from our own perspective, we can recognize some changes as being for the better. We may have an instinctive conservatism about human nature, but intellectually we can see the links between our psychology and the threats to our survival. The voice of the intellect is a soft one, but in some of us, some of the time, it gains a hearing.</p>
                <p>We cannot stand quite outside our own values. But it does not follow that we should create for future generations exactly the kind of world we like. Some of the envisaged possible applications of neurobiology are attractive now: perhaps some mood-changing drugs, or some uses of self administered brain stimulation. Where we resist other applications. we can sometimes recognize and make allowances for the bias of our limited experience and understanding. Perhaps we are glad to have a private inner life, and relieved not to be transparent to other people. We can feel this, and still see that people who had made the transition to transparency might find the gains far greater than the losses. We can make allowances for our own limitations here, and for this reason we may wish to encourage experiments in lowering the barriers of privacy.</p>
                <p>In an appropriately cautious way, we should be willing to change what we are like. Some of the dangers are obvious. There are the standard dangers of any new technology: miscalculation and disastrous accidents. And there are the deeper risks of social misuse. These technologies may fall into the bands of governments who aim to enslave people. Or the danger may come from shallow and thoughtless commercial exploitation. People could make profits from selling genetic or neurobiological technology with short-term advantages, without any thought of the world that would result. It needs no emphasis that these dangers are unusually important with the technologies we are considering. Here, accidents or misuse will influence what sort of people there will be. The other great threat is perhaps less obvious, but I hope it has emerged in this discussion. The danger is that these technologies will be harnessed to a benevolent utopianism which has too crude a view of what life can be. An example is the one-dimensional utilitarianism which aims in a simple way at the maximum satisfaction of desires. A programme based on this outlook could succeed in harmonizing our desires and the world, at the cost of obliterating the self-expressive and self-creative life we now care about. Perhaps it would lock us into the pointless circular activity of the Human Zoo, or put us all on to simple experience machines. In either case, the countervailing desires which come from other perspectives would be eliminated.</p>
                <p>One of the worst fears is that we might never escape from these self perpetuating states. Sometimes, as in certain versions of the experience machine, the programme wipes out all consciousness of other kinds of life. Sometimes it leaves awareness of other possibilities, but wipes out any desire for them. Once we have lost such awareness or desires, there is no certainty they will return. We may have shut down options more valuable than the contentment we have gained. This is a danger which is not confined to crude versions of utilitarianism. It arises with any scheme which has utopian pretensions to finality. It will be avoided if what prevails is belief in human variety and in keeping alive the possibilities of change.</p>

                <h3 id="consciousness">4 Consciousness</h3>
                <p>The problems we confront now are about ensuring our survival and about eliminating the causes of misery. They will be with us for some time. But, as biotechnology advances, another wave of problems will be upon us. Here a central danger is closing down possibilities: the dreamworld is only an extreme case of this. And this danger may have to be overcome in order to create the perspective from which it can be fully appreciated. (We can see, in a way primitive men could not, how much would have been lost if they bad found a drug giving them contentment at the cost of any further intellectual development.)</p>
                <p>Our present wave of problems exists partly because modern physical technology has come too early in our social development: before we have outgrown our tribalism and our wars of religion. The parallel danger is that biotechnology will come too soon, and we will shut ourselves into a world more cramping than we need. We may fall into what would seem, from the viewpoint of a more developed consciousness, to be a contented stupor.</p>
                <p>John Donne, in one of his sermons, said: 'We are all conceived in close prison, and then all our life is but a going out to the place of execution, to death. Was any man seen to sleep in the cart between Newgate and Tyburn? Between prison and the place of execution does any man sleep? But we sleep all the way. From the womb to the grave, we are never thoroughly awake.'</p>
                <p>One claim here has been that consciousness is especially important: that all value derives from contributions to the lives of conscious beings. But it does not follow that pleasurable experience is the only thing of value. A whole life passively consuming pleasure is a narrow one. A broader view of the good life centres on activities and relationships. We mind about the kinds of things we do, and we want to experience things with other people. We also like to think and talk together, sharing and helping to shape each other's responses. In this way we express ourselves, and partly create ourselves and each other. Bach of us, to a very small extent, contributes to the development of human consciousness. As a result we, and our descendants, go through life more thoroughly awake.</p>
