    <h2 id="introduction"><em>Chapter 1</em> Introduction</h2>
    <p>This book is about some questions to do with the future of mankind. The questions have been selected on two grounds. They arise out of scientific developments whose beginnings we can already see, such as genetic engineering and behaviour control. And they involve fundamental values: these technologies may change the central framework of human life. The book is intended as a contribution, not to prediction, but to a discussion of what sort of future we should try to bring about.</p>
    <div class="point" epub:type="subchapter">
        <h3 id="the-questions">1 The Questions</h3>
        <p>At one level, the questions fall into two groups. Some are about what we should do with genetic engineering. Perhaps one day we shall be able to choose people's genetic characteristics. How should we decide what sort of people there should be? Or are there reasons for refusing to make such decisions? The second group of questions is about the possible impact of technologies based on neurobiology, psychology and artificial intelligence. We may greatly increase our ability to alter people's experiences, and to control their motives and actions. We may develop far more powerful techniques for monitoring both behaviour and mental states. Such power to control and to understand people seems a threat to autonomy and to privacy. It may also threaten other things, such as our sense of identity, or the value we place on having relatively undistorted experience of the world as it really is. Other problems are raised by the development of machines able to duplicate or surpass our abilities and skills. Which activities should we keep for ourselves? What will the knowledge of our replaceability do to our way of seeing ourselves and what we do?</p>
        <p>The issues raised by these possible future technologies are, at one level, very varied. But part of the argument developed here will be that, at another level, many of the same questions about our basic values recur in these different contexts. These central common themes are often lost<span class="page-break">13</span> sight of in the discussion of a particular topic, such as genetic engineering, where the shape of people's views is largely determined by what they think is likely to happen in practice. Perhaps by taking several topics it may be possible to show in clearer outline the central questions about values. These are questions about what human life should be like, and what sort of people there should be.</p>
        <p>I have paid only rather limited attention to current beliefs about which technical developments are probable and which improbable. This is for several reasons. Predictions of that kind are usually short-term, and lose plausibility when extended beyond a decade or so. The time-span here is not intended to be limited to a few decades. Even in the short term, predictions of technical developments are often wrong: the atomic bomb exploded a decade after Rutherford ruled out the possibility of any practical application of atomic energy. And, because people, thought to be realistic, only believe developments are likely when they are nearly upon us, the time we have to think about what to do with discoveries is usually much too short. There is something to be said for taking a generous view of what may happen, so that we develop the habit of thinking about the best policy well in advance, rather than always too late.</p>
        <p>Many people, when thinking of such possibilities as genetic engineering or techniques for controlling behaviour, have a reaction of rather inarticulate horror or revulsion. It is much easier to feel disturbed and repelled by these enterprises than it is to give a coherent account of precisely what the objections are. If we stay inarticulate, events will perhaps take one of two courses. The first is that the techniques will be adopted, in a piecemeal way, a little at a time. The advocates will at each stage be able to offer some specifiable gain, such as a reduction in the crime rate, or an increase in average intelligence, and each time this may seem more compelling than rather vaguely formulated objections on principle. By easy stages, we could move to a world which none of us would choose if we could see it as a whole from the start. Another possibility is that our resistance will prove too deeply rooted for all this, and that these techniques will fall under some general and undiscriminating ban. This will be a less disturbing outcome from our point of view, as the world will remain more as it is now. But the result may be that future generations will lose things they would have found of great value. Leaving the objections at the level of inarticulate opposition excludes the possibility of discriminating between desirable and undesirable applications of the new technologies.<span class="page-break">14</span></p>
        <p>These questions are worth thinking about only on certain assumptions. One is that we do have a future: that we will not die out because of shortages of food or energy, and that we will not destroy ourselves by war or by some other blunder. We cannot be certain that this assumption is correct. The avoidance of such disasters is our immediate problem, and one more urgent to think about than the questions of this book. But in thinking, as elsewhere, there is division of labour, and not everyone should concentrate on the most urgent questions to the exclusion of longer-term issues. And. If we do have a future, these questions about what sort of people there should be, which are starting to creep up on us now, will be more urgent themselves.</p>
        <p>Another presupposition is that the future of the human race will be determined, at least in part, by what people decide. There is an obvious way in which this is true. Decisions to use or not to use genetic engineering in certain ways will make a difference to the composition of subsequent generations. But there are views according to which thinking about the sort of world we want is a waste of time, because what happens is determined by social or technological forces far more powerful than the values people have. Clearly the shape of society is not determined only by our thoughts and desires. Yet it is hardly plausible that our values have no impact at all on what the world is like. And, to the extent that we are able to choose between different futures, it is worth thinking about how desirable we find them.</p>
        <p>About the questions discussed, I have the same thought that P. B. Medawar expressed about the questions of his Reith lectures on <em>The Future of Man</em>.<span class="footnote-anchor"></span><span class="footnote" data-num="1">1. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00h9lc9">The Future of Man (The Reith Lectures. 1959)</a>. London, 1960.</span> He said, 'I think that the answers to questions of this kind, in so far as it is possible to answer them, are deeply necessary for any understanding of the future of man; and when I say that they are necessary, please remember that I have not said, and do not imply, that they are sufficient.'</p>

        <h3 id="the-approach">2 The Approach</h3>
        <p>The discussion falls into three parts. The first part is about genetic engineering. The second is about technologies related in one way or another to the brain. The third is about some general issues arising from the other parts.<span class="page-break">15</span></p>
        <p>The discussion of genetic engineering has as a central theme the question of whether it is desirable to try to modify human nature. Genetic engineering seems a good test case for this question, as it seems to open up the possibility of more fundamental changes than we could otherwise envisage. Perhaps partly for this reason, it arouses in us kinds of resistance that go very deep. There are other issues discussed: whether genetic change is different in principle from environmental change; whether the distinction between remedying genetic defects and making genetic improvements is important: and problems about who should take decisions about genetic changes. But, important as these other issues are, the central issue is about changing human nature. I want to argue for greater willingness to consider policies that would do this, so it seems important to meet conservatism about human nature on its strongest ground. The aim of the discussion is to diagnose the varied sources of our resistance to genetic engineering, and to see how far they withstand scrutiny when separated. My hope is to give due weight to the legitimate sources of anxiety and resistance, and, by doing this, to detach them from what seems to me a misguided opposition in principle to any changes in our nature.</p>
        <p>If we reject any general ban on changing human nature, it is then obviously important to think about the values to be used in deciding for or against any proposed change. The second part of the book, which is mainly about possible future technology applied to the brain, attempts to bring the relevant values into sharper focus. The aim is to apply to some of our values an approach Bertrand Russell spoke of in a quite different context. He said, 'The process of sound philosophizing, to my mind, consists mainly in passing from the obvious, vague, ambiguous things, that we feel quite sure of, to something precise, clear, definite, which by reflection and analysis we find is involved in the vague thing we start from, and is, so to speak, the real truth of which that vague thing is a sort of shadow.'<span class="footnote-anchor"></span><span class="footnote" data-num="2">2. <cite><a href="http://www.users.drew.edu/~jlenz/br-logical-atomism0.html">The Philosophy of logical Atomism</a></cite>, London. 1918. Lecture One.</span></p>
        <p>The method to be used here for moving from the vague shadow to something more precise does not derive from Russell. It has been used throughout the history of philosophy since Socrates. The reader is presented with a series of thought experiments: in this case various technologies will be imagined in extreme forms. My responses will be given to these possibilities, in the hope that the reader too will have some responses.<span class="page-break">16</span></p>
        <p>I said earlier that little notice will be taken of which technical developments are thought probable (though none of the ones to be discussed is now known to be impossible). This will strike many as a serious weakness. On the conventional view, nothing is more damning than the criticism that some issue being discussed is based on assumptions that are 'unrealistic'. On this view, the way to think about issues like behaviour control is to avoid far-out science-fiction cases, and confine our thinking to the developments that, from our present perspective, seem likely. I hold the opposite view. In thinking about the desirability of various developments, it is often best deliberately to confront the most extreme possibility. Why is this?</p>
        <p>Thinking about the desirability of different futures cannot be separated from thinking about present values. And our values often become clearer when we consider imaginary cases where conflicts can be made sharp. The complexity of practical detail, so essential to a decision in a particular context, has a softening and blurring effect when we are trying to think about what our priorities are in general. Also, if we consider 'moderate' rather than extreme cases, our judgements are often influenced by awareness of being on a slippery slope. Rather than the extreme development being fully ignored, it lurks unconfronted as the thought of some nameless horror further down the slope. Another feature of thinking only about what at the time seems likely, is that we are hardly ever able to choose between kinds of life in general. We are limited to piecemeal decisions. A series of incremental decisions can lead us somewhere we would never have chosen to go in the first place, and rule out places we might have done well to go to. Lack of realism is a serious criticism of practical proposals, such as an economic programme based on false factual assumptions. It is not a serious criticism of philosophical thought experiments about values, unless it is supposed that responses reflecting our real priorities can only be elicited by very familiar and homely kinds of cases. This is often asserted, but less often argued for.<span class="footnote-anchor"></span><span class="footnote" data-num="3">3. All the same. The reader should bear in mind a comment by Nancy Davis on on earlier draft or this book: "I don't think that we can so easily suppose that our reactions are linear: that we can apply our reactions to sci-fi cases back our mundane judgements.'</span> When Russell talked of moving from the vague, shadowy belief to something precise, he had in mind the philosophical analysis of common-sense beliefs of a quite uncontroversial kind, such as that the room he was lecturing in contained a number of people. But, in discussing values,<span class="page-break">17</span> it is less obvious that there are agreed beliefs to start from. Some of the values that will figure prominently here might have meant little to a medieval European, and may mean little now to people in China or Japan. And even among the likely readers of this book, although I hope there will be understanding of its values, it would be unrealistic to expect general agreement.</p>
        <p>The aim is to bring out some of the underlying questions of value more clearly. The intention is to describe possibilities in ways that separate out different values, and to say, 'these values, rather than those, are what matter, aren't they?' Of course, in a way I hope for the answer 'yes'. But, because people have different outlooks, the answer will quite often be 'no'. My hope is that those who answer 'no' will have been helped to see more clearly what it is they do not believe, and perhaps as a result to work out more fully what they do believe. Some people hope for more than this from philosophical discussion of values. What they hope for, and what some philosophers attempt to provide, is a proof of the validity of one set of values, and a demonstration that others are mistaken. There is not room here to argue the matter, but I am sceptical of the possibility of this. It is a tempting fantasy for someone writing a book like this one to think that any reader who is rational and who understands the argument will be transformed into a person with the same views as the writer. However tempting, it is still a fantasy.</p>
        <p>But there is a different way of seeing argument in ethics. Perhaps its social function is to spell out different sets of values more fully than they usually appear, so that people can accept or reject policies with greater awareness of the implications of their choices. This more modest function may still be worthwhile. For there is a danger that we will drift into a world much less good than we could have, as the result of making piecemeal, short-term decisions, rather than thinking coherently about kinds of life as a whole.</p>
        <p>One stage of thinking about a possible future world is to ask ourselves what we like or dislike about it, and what reasons we have. This involves both judging that possible world by our own values, and critical reflection on those values themselves. For the reasons we give may turn out, when clearly stated, to be open to criticism. Objections to the conditioning techniques used in <em>Brave New World</em> invite the challenge to say just what it is that makes them worse than the more haphazard<span class="page-break">18</span> methods used in our own society. Perhaps this challenge can be met, but on the way we will be forced to do some fresh thinking about what autonomy is, and why we value it.</p>
        <p>The third part of the book tries to place the discussion in a larger context. Suppose we are fairly clear about our own reasons for approving or disapproving of a particular kind of society. Many possible kinds of future world (Brave New World is one) come out badly in terms of some of our values, and yet would be highly rated by their inhabitants. Changes in society and in human nature can be expected to involve changes in values. So the next stage of thinking is to ask what we should try to do for future generations. Should we care at all what sort of people there are, a hundred years from now, and what their life is like? If we should, what is the role of our own attitudes in assessing ways of life in which those attitudes would no longer exist? One thought here is that, in deciding what we ought to do, there is no total escape from our own viewpoint. On the other band, it seems parochial and constricting to take decisions about the future with only our own outlook in mind. Perhaps we should not give our own late-twentieth-century attitudes a privileged position? But, even if we decide to give weight to future attitudes we do not share, commitment to this degree of impartiality must be a feature of our own system of values. Here too, thinking about the future is a way of thinking about ourselves.<span class="page-break">19</span><span class="page-break">20</span></p>
