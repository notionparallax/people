                <h4>Nobel 'Super Babies'</h4>
                <p>Three exceptionally intelligent women have been fertilized from a sperm bank whose donors are all Nobel prize-winning scientists, the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> reported yesterday.</p>
                <p>The babies, due this year, would be the first to result from a programme set up by a California businessman, Mr Robert Graham, aimed at producing people of superior intelligence, the newspaper said. One of the sperm donors was Dr William Shockley, aged 70, who shared the Nobel prize for Physics in 1956, it was reported. Dr Shockley caused a minor sensation in the early 1970s when the US National Academy of Sciences refused to sponsor a study of his contention that human intelligence was mostly the result of heredity. He said that blacks scored on average about 15 points below whites in intelligence tests.</p>
                <p>The newspaper quoted Mr Graham, aged 74, as saying that so far at least four Nobel prize-winners in addition to Dr Shockley had donated to the sperm bank. Apart from the three women who have been inseminated, more than a dozen have expressed interest in the idea, the newspaper said.</p>
                <p>It said the existence of the sperm bank was confirmed by Dr Shockley and at least five other people. 'Yes, I'm one of them.' Dr Shockley was quoted as saying. He said he was disappointed that more of his fellow Nobel scientists had not been willing to add their names to what he called 'this good cause'.</p>

                <p>Sir,</p>
                <p>May I, as a citizen and a Nobel laureate, make a few comments on your front-page story ('Nobel Super Babies')?</p>
                <p>The vast majority of Nobel laureates are scientists, most of them<span class="page-break">23</span> specialists. They are not necessarily all of superior intelligence; they are primarily men and women who have been <em>successful</em> in a particular kind of intellectual endeavour, and people of comparable stature are to be found in large numbers in all walks of life.</p>
                <p>As one of our foremost biologists, Sir Peter Medawar, has several times explained clearly, 'positive eugenics', i.e. breeding for the 'improvement' of the human species, is for many reasons not practicable. Even if Mr Graham's project is to be considered an experiment, it will never be possible to judge its results, since Nobel laureates are a very small sample even of the world's scientists.</p>
                <p>As is now well known, the development of intelligence, as it is usually understood, is only partly controlled by heredity. At any rate, it is equally vital for success in life that a child grows up in a harmonious family and that he be offered the best possible opportunities for education.</p>
                <p>By consenting to take part in Mr Graham's ill-considered project, the five Nobel laureates and the three women involved have raised doubts about their possession of the very asset they want to pass on to their offspring: intelligence.</p>
                <p>Finally, I find it morally reprehensible and presumptuous for anybody to put himself forward as a judge of the qualities for which we should breed.</p>

        <p>Should we try to alter the genetic composition of future generations? Eugenic proposals, such as those of Mr Graham and Dr Shockley, have always aroused strong passions. Some hope that we can escape from our present innate limitations, and discard our less admirable qualities. Seen in this way, adopting a policy of deliberate genetic change would be a beneficial turning-point in the history of the human race. Others think of the abuses (perhaps remembering the Nazi experiment) and feel revulsion and dread at the horrors even a well-intentioned policy could lead to.</p>
        <p>This debate, while confined to eugenics, has not been at the centre of attention, because of doubts about the workability of eugenic schemes. The debate will become less academic if we develop genetic engineering techniques to give us power directly to choose the genes of future people.<span class="page-break">24</span></p>
        <p>My concern, in the first part of this book, is to raise the question of bow far, if at all, we should adopt policies designed to change human nature. I take the particular case of genetic engineering because it may provide the most extreme possibilities of this, and seems likely to arouse the deepest resistance. It poses the underlying issues with particular sharpness.</p>
        <p>There is a widespread view that any project for the genetic improvement of the human race ought to be ruled out: that there are fundamental objections of principle. The aim of this discussion is to sort out some of the main objections. It will be argued that our resistance is based on a complex of different values and reasons, none of which is, when examined, adequate to rule out in principle this use of genetic engineering. The debate on human genetic engineering should become like the debate on nuclear power: one in which large possible benefits have to be weighed against big problems and the risk of great disasters. The discussion has not reached this point, partly because the techniques have not yet been developed. But it is also partly because of the blurred vision which fuses together many separate risks and doubts into a fuzzy-outlined opposition in principle.</p>

            <h3 id="avoiding-the-debate-about-genes-and-the-environment">1 Avoiding the Debate about Genes and the Environment</h3>
            <p>In discussing the question of genetic engineering, there is everything to be said for not muddling the issue up with the debate over the relative importance of genes and environment in the development of such characteristics as intelligence. One reason for avoiding that debate is that it arouses even stronger passions than genetic engineering, and so is filled with as much acrimony as argument. But, apart from this fastidiousness, there are other reasons.</p>
            <p>The nature-nurture dispute is generally seen as an argument about the relative weight the two factors have in causing differences within the human species: 'IQ is 80 per cent hereditary and 20 per cent environmental' versus 'IQ is 80 per cent environmental and 20 per cent hereditary'. No doubt there is some approximate truth of this type to be found if we consider variations within a given population at a particular time. But it is highly unlikely that there is any such statement<span class="page-break">25</span> which is simply true of human nature regardless of context To take the extreme case, if we could iron out all environmental differences, any residual variations would be 100 per cent genetic. It is only if we make the highly artificial assumption that different groups at different times all have an identical spread of relevant environmental differences that we can expect to find statements of this kind applying to human nature in general. To say this is not to argue that studies on the question should not be conducted, or are bound to fail. It may well be possible, and useful, to find out the relative weights of the two kinds of factor for a given characteristic among a certain group at a particular time. The point is that any such conclusions lose relevance, not only when environmental differences are stretched out or compressed, but also when genetic differences are. And this last case is what we are considering. We can avoid this dispute because of its irrelevance. Suppose the genetic engineering proposal were to try to make people less aggressive. On a superficial view, the proposal might be shown to be unrealistic if there were evidence to show that variation in aggressiveness is hardly genetic at all: that it is 95 per cent environmental. (Let us grant, most implausibly, that such a figure turned out to be true for the whole of humanity, regardless of social context.) But all this would show is that, within our species, the distribution of genes relevant to aggression is very uniform. It would show nothing about the likely effects on aggression if we use genetic engineering to give people a different set of genes from those they now have.</p>
            <p>In other words, to take genetic engineering seriously, we need take no stand on the relative importance or unimportance of genetic factors in the explanation of the present range of individual differences found in people. We need only the minimal assumption that different genes could give us different characteristics. To deny that assumption you need to be the sort of person who thinks it is only living in kennels which makes dogs different from cats.</p>

            <h3 id="methods-of-changing-the-genetic-composition-of-future-generations">2 Methods of Changing the Genetic Composition of Future Generations</h3>
            <p>There are essentially three ways of altering the genetic composition of future generations. The first is by environmental changes. Discoveries<span class="page-break">26</span> in medicine, the institution of a National Health Service, schemes for poverty relief, agricultural changes, or alterations in the tax position of large families, all alter the selective pressures on genes.<span class="footnote-anchor"></span><span class="footnote" data-num="1">1. Chris Graham has suggested to me that it is misleading to say this without emphasizing the painful slowness or this way or changing gene frequencies.</span> It is hard to think of any social change which does not make some difference to who survives or who is born.</p>
            <p>The second method is to use eugenic policies aimed at altering breeding patterns or patterns of survival of people with different genes. Eugenic methods are 'environmental' too: the difference is only that the genetic impact is intended. Possible strategies range from various kinds of compulsion (to have more children, fewer children, or no children, or even compulsion over the choice of sexual partner) to the completely voluntary (our present genetic counselling practice of giving prospective parents information about probabilities of their children having various abnormalities).</p>
            <p>The third method is genetic engineering: using enzymes to add to or subtract from a stretch of DNA.</p>
            <p>Most people are unworried by the fact that a side-effect of an environmental change is to alter the gene pool, at least where the alteration is not for the worse. And even in cases where environmental factors increase the proportion of undesirable genes in the pool, we often accept this. Few people oppose the National Health Service, although setting it up meant that some people with genetic defects, who would have died, have had treatment enabling them to survive and reproduce. On the whole, we accept without qualms that much of what we do has genetic impact. Controversy starts when we think of aiming deliberately at genetic changes, by eugenics or genetic engineering. I want to make some brief remarks about eugenic policies, before suggesting that policies of deliberate intervention are best considered in the context of genetic engineering. Scepticism has been expressed about whether eugenic policies have any practical chance of success. Medawar has pointed out the importance of genetic polymorphism: the persistence of genetically different types in a population.<span class="footnote-anchor"></span><span class="footnote" data-num="2">2. The future of Man (The Reith Lectures, 1959). London. 1960. <em>chapter 3</em>; and in 'The Genetic Improvement of man'. In The Hope of Progress. London. 1972.</span> (Our different blood groups are a familiar example.) For many characteristics, people get a different gene from each parent. So children do not simply repeat parental characteristics. Any simple picture<span class="page-break">27</span> of producing an improved type of person, and then letting the improvement be passed on unchanged, collapses.</p>
            <p>But, although polymorphism is a problem for this crudely utopian form of eugenics, it does not show that more modest schemes of improvement must fail. Suppose the best individuals for some quality (say, colour vision) are heterozygous, so that they inherit a gene A from one parent, and a gene B from the other. These ABs will have AAs and BBs among their children, who will be less good than they are. But AAs and BBs may still be better than ACs or ADs, and perhaps much better than CCs or COs. If this were so, overall improvement could still be brought about by encouraging people whose genes included an A or a B to have more children than those who had only Cs or Ds. The point of taking a quality like colour vision is that it may be genetically fairly simple. Qualities like kindness or intelligence are more likely to depend on the interaction of many genes, but a similar point can be made at a higher level of complexity.</p>
            <p>Polymorphism raises a doubt about whether the offspring of the three 'exceptionally intelligent women' fertilized by Dr Shockley or other Nobel prize-winners will have the same IQ as the parents, even apart from environmental variation. But it does not show the inevitable failure of any large-scale attempts to alter human characteristics by varying the relative numbers of children different kinds of people have. Yet any attempt, say, to raise the level of intelligence, would be a very slow affair, taking many generations to make much of an impact. This is one reason for preferring to discuss genetic engineering. For the genetic engineering of human improvements, if it becomes possible, will have an immediate effect, so we will not be guessing which qualities will be desirable dozens of generations later.</p>
            <p>There is the view that the genetic-engineering techniques required will not become a practical possibility. Sir Macfarlane Burnet, writing in 1971 about using genetic engineering to cure disorders in people already born, dismissed the possibility of using a virus to carry a new gene to replace a faulty one in cells throughout the body: 'I should be willing to state in any company that the chance of doing this will remain infinitely small to the last syllable of recorded time.<span class="footnote-anchor"></span><span class="footnote" data-num="3">3. <em>Giants. Dreams and Realities</em>, London. 1971. p. 81</span> Unless engineering at the stage of sperm cell and egg is easier, this seems a confident<span class="page-break">28</span> dismissal of the topic to be discussed here. More recent work casts doubt on this confidence.<span class="footnote-anchor"></span><span class="footnote" data-num="4">4. Already they have pushed Cline's results further, obtaining transfer between rabbit and mouse. For example, and good expression or the foreign gene in Its new host. Some, by transferring the genes into the developing eggs, have managed to get the new genes into every cell in the mouse. Including the sex cells: those mice have fathered offspring who also contain the foreign gene.' Jeremy Cherfas: <em>Man Made Life</em>, Oxford. 1982, pp. 229-30.</span> So, having mentioned this scepticism. I shall disregard it. We will assume that genetic engineering of people may become possible, and that it is worth discussing. (Sir Macfarlane Burnet's view has not yet been falsified as totally as Rutherford's view about atomic energy. But I hope that the last syllable of recorded time is still some way off.)</p>
            <p>The main reason for casting the discussion in terms of genetic engineering rather than eugenics is not a practical one. Many eugenic policies are open to fairly straightforward moral objections, which hide the deeper theoretical issues. Such policies as compulsory sterilization, compulsory abortion, compelling people to pair off in certain ways, or compelling people to have more or fewer children than they would otherwise have, are all open to objection on grounds of overriding people's autonomy. Some are open to objection on grounds of damage to the institution of the family. And the use of discriminatory tax and child benefit policies is an intolerable step towards a society of different genetic castes.</p>
            <p>Genetic engineering need not involve overriding anyone's autonomy. It need not be forced on parents against their wishes, and the future person being engineered has no views to be overridden. {The view that despite this, it is still objectionable to have one's genetic characteristics decided by others, will be considered later.) Genetic engineering will not damage the family in the obvious ways that compulsory eugenic policies would. Nor need it be encouraged by incentives which create inequalities. Because it avoids these highly visible moral objections, genetic engineering allows us to focus more clearly on other values that are involved.</p>
            <p>(To avoid a possible misunderstanding, one point should be added before leaving the topic of eugenics. Saying that some eugenic policies are open to obvious moral objections does not commit me to disapproval of all eugenic policies. In particular. I do not want to be taken to be opposing two kinds of policy. One is genetic counselling: warning people of risks<span class="page-break">29</span> in having children, and perhaps advising them against having them. The other is the introduction of screening-programmes to detect foetal abnormalities, followed by giving the mother the option of abortion where serious defects emerge.)</p>
            <p>Let us now turn to the question of what, if anything, we should do in the field of human genetic engineering.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="point" epub:type="subchapter">
            <h3 id="the-positive-negative-distinction">3 The Positive&ndash;Negative Distinction</h3>
            <p>We are not yet able to cure disorders by genetic engineering. But we do sometimes respond to disorders by adopting eugenic policies, at least in voluntary form. Genetic counselling is one instance, as applied to those thought likely to have such disorders as Huntington's chorea. This is a particularly appalling inherited disorder, involving brain degeneration, leading to mental decline and lack of control over movement. It does not normally come on until middle age, by which time many of its victims would in the normal course of things have had children. Huntington's chorea is caused by a dominant gene, so those who find that one of their parents has it have themselves a 50 per cent chance of developing it. U they do have it, each of their children will in turn have a 50 per cent chance of the disease. The risks are so high and the disorder so bad that the potential parents often decide not to have children, and are often given advice to this effect by doctors and others.</p>
            <p>Another eugenic response to disorders is involved in screening programmes for pregnant women. When tests pick up such defects as Down's syndrome (mongolism) or spina bifida, the mother is given the possibility of an abortion. The screening-programmes are eugenic because part of their point is to reduce the incidence of severe genetic abnormality in the population.</p>
            <p>These two eugenic policies come in at different stages: before conception and during pregnancy. For this reason the screening programme is more controversial, because it raises the issue of abortion. Those who are sympathetic to abortion, and who think it would be good to eliminate these disorders will be sympathetic to the programme. Those who think abortion is no different from killing a fully developed human are obviously likely to oppose the programme. But they are likely to feel that elimination of the disorders would be a good thing, even if not<span class="page-break">30</span> an adequate justification for killing. Unless they also disapprove of contraception, they are likely to support the genetic-counselling policy in the case of Huntington's chorea.</p>
            <p>Few people object to the use of eugenic policies to eliminate disorders, unless those policies have additional features which are objectionable. Most of us are resistant to the use of compulsion, and those who oppose abortion will object to screening-programmes. But apart from these other moral objections, we do not object to the use of eugenic policies against disease. We do not object to advising those likely to have Huntington's chorea not to have children, as neither compulsion nor killing is involved. Those of us who take this view have no objection to altering the genetic composition of the next generation, where this alteration consists in reducing the incidence of defects.</p>
            <p>If it were possible to use genetic engineering to correct defects, say at the foetal stage, it is hard to see how those of us who are prepared to use the eugenic measures just mentioned could object. In both cases, it would be pure gain. The couple, one of whom may develop Huntington's chorea, can have a child if they want, knowing that any abnormality will be eliminated. Those sympathetic to abortion will agree that cure is preferable. And those opposed to abortion prefer babies to be born without handicap. It is hard to think of any objection to using genetic engineering to eliminate defects, and there is a clear and strong case for its use.</p>
            <p>But accepting the case for eliminating genetic mistakes does not entail accepting other uses of genetic engineering. The elimination of defects is often called 'negative' genetic engineering. Going beyond this, to bring about improvements in normal people, is by contrast 'positive' engineering. (The same distinction can be made for eugenics.) The positive-negative distinction is not in all cases completely sharp. Some conditions are genetic disorders whose identification raises little problem. Huntington's chorea or spina bifida are genetic 'mistakes' in a way that cannot seriously be disputed. But with other conditions, the boundary between a defective state and normality may be more blurred. If there is a genetic disposition towards depressive illness, this seems a defect, whose elimination would be part of negative genetic engineering. Suppose the genetic disposition to depression involves the production of lower levels of an enzyme than are produced in normal people. The negative programme is to correct the genetic fault so that the enzyme<span class="page-break">31</span> level is within the range found in normal people. But suppose that within 'normal' people also, there are variations in the enzyme level, which correlate with ordinary differences in tendency to be cheerful or depressed. Is there a sharp boundary between 'clinical' depression and the depression sometimes felt by those diagnosed as 'normal'? Is it clear that a sharp distinction can be drawn between raising someone's enzyme level so that it falls within the normal range and raising someone else's level from the bottom of the normal range to the top?</p>
            <p>The positive-negative distinction is sometimes a blurred one, but often we can at least roughly see where it should be drawn. If there is a rough and ready distinction, the question is: how important is it? Should we go on from accepting negative engineering to accepting positive programmes, or should we say that the line between the two is the limit of what is morally acceptable?</p>
            <p>There is no doubt that positive programmes arouse the strongest feelings on both sides. On the one hand, many respond to positive genetic engineering or positive eugenics with Professor Tinbergen's thought: 'I find it morally reprehensible and presumptuous for anybody to put himself forward as a judge of the qualities for which we should breed.' But other people have held just as strongly that positive policies are the way to make the future of mankind better than the past. Many years ago H. J. Muller expressed this hope:</p>
            <blockquote>And so we foresee the history or lire divided into three main phases. In the long preparatory phase it was the helpless creature or its environment, and natural selection gradually ground it into human shape. In the second&mdash;our own short transitional phase&mdash;it reaches out at the immediate environment, shaking, shaping and grinding to suit the form, the requirements, the wishes, and the whims or man. And in the long third phase, it will reach down into the secret places or the great universe or its own nature, and by aid or its ever growing intelligence and cooperation, shape itself into an increasingly sublime creation&mdash;a being beside which the mythical divinities or the past will seem more and more ridiculous, and which setting its own marvellous inner powers against the brute Goliath or the suns and the planets, challenges them to contest.</blockquote><span class="footnote-anchor"></span><span class="footnote" data-num="5">5. <em>Out of the Night</em>. New York. 1935. To find a distinguished geneticist talking like this after the Nazi period is not easy.</span>
            <p>The case for positive engineering is not helped by adopting the tones of the mad scientist in a horror film. But behind the rhetoric is a serious point. If we decide on a positive programme to change our nature,<span class="page-break">32</span> this will be a central moment in our history, and the transformation might be beneficial to a degree we can now scarcely imagine. The question is: how are we to weigh this possibility against Tinbergen's objection, and against other objections and doubts?</p>
            <p>For the rest of this discussion, I shall assume that, subject to adequate safeguards against things going wrong, negative genetic engineering is acceptable. The issue is positive engineering. I shall also assume that we can ignore problems about whether positive engineering will be technically possible. Suppose we have the power to choose people's genetic characteristics. Once we have eliminated genetic defects, what, if anything, should we do with this power?</p>
            <p>The strategy of the discussion will be to separate out some different objections to positive engineering. In the next chapter some general issues of principle will be considered. The rest of this present chapter is about some more localized objections. There is the view that any benefit from a genetic improvement will be balanced by a related drawback. There are objections about damage to the family. There are criticisms of particular applications, such as cloning, or crossing species boundaries. And there are objections to the risks involved, and to the possibility of mistakes.</p>

            <h3 id="the-view-that-overall-improvement-is-unlikely-or-impossible">4 The View That Overall improvement is Unlikely or impossible</h3>
            <p>There is one doubt about the workability of schemes of genetic improvement which is so widespread that it would be perverse to ignore it. This is the view that, in any genetic alteration, there are no gains without compensating losses. On this view, if we bring about a genetically based improvement, such as higher intelligence, we arc bound to pay a price somewhere else: perhaps the more intelligent people will have less resistance to disease, or will be less physically agile. If correct, this might so undermine the practicability of applying eugenics or genetic engineering that it would be hardly worth discussing the values involved in such programmes.</p>
            <p>This view perhaps depends on some idea that natural selection is so efficient that, in terms of gene survival, we must already be as efficient as it is possible to be. If it were possible to push up intelligence without<span class="page-break">33</span> weakening some other part of the system, natural selection would already have done so. But this is a naive version of evolutionary theory. In real evolutionary theory, far from the genetic status quo always being the best possible for a given environment, some mutations turn out to be advantageous, and this is the origin of evolutionary progress. If natural mutations can be beneficial without a compensating loss, why should artificially induced ones not be so too?</p>
            <p>It should also be noticed that there are two different ideas of what counts as a gain or a loss. From the point of view of evolutionary progress, gains and losses are simply advantages and disadvantages from the point of view of gene survival. But we are not compelled to take this view. If we could engineer a genetic change in some people which would have the effect of making them musical prodigies but also sterile, this would be a hopeless gene in terms of survival, but this need not force us, or the musical prodigies themselves, to think of the change as for the worse. It depends on bow we rate musical ability as against having children, and evolutionary survival does not dictate priorities here. The view that gains and losses are tied up with each other need not depend on the dogma that natural selection <em>must</em> have created the best of all possible sets of genes. A more cautiously empirical version of the claim says there is a tendency for gains to be accompanied by losses. John Maynard Smith, in his paper on 'Eugenics and Utopia',<span class="footnote-anchor"></span><span class="footnote" data-num="6">6. John Maynard Smith: <em>On Evolution</em>. Edinburgh. 1972; the article is reprinted from the issue on 'Utopia' or <em>Daedalus, Journal of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences</em>. 1965.</span> takes this kind of 'broad balance' view and runs it the other way, suggesting, as an argument in defence of medicine, that any loss of genetic resistance to disease is likely to be a good thing: 'The reason for this is that in evolution, as in other fields, one seldom gets something for nothing. Genes which confer disease-resistance are likely to have harmful effects in other ways; this is certainly true of the gene for sickle-cell anaemia and may be a general rule. If so, absence of selection in favour of disease resistance may be eugenic.'</p>
            <p>It is important that different characteristics may turn out to be genetically linked in ways we do not yet realize. In our present state of knowledge, engineering for some improvement might easily bring some unpredicted but genetically linked disadvantage. But we do not have to accept that there will in general be a broad balance, so that there is a presumption that any gain will be accompanied by a compensating loss<span class="page-break">34</span> (or Maynard Smith's version that we can expect a compensating gain for any loss). The reason is that what counts as a gain or loss varies in different contexts. Take Maynard Smith's example of sickle-cell anaemia. The reason why sickle-cell anaemia is widespread in Africa is that it is genetically linked with resistance to malaria. Those who are heterozygous (who inherit one sickle-cell gene and one normal gene) are resistant to malaria, while those who are homozygous (whose genes are both sickle-cell) get sickle-cell anaemia. If we use genetic engineering to knock out sickle-cell anaemia where malaria is common, we will pay the price of having more malaria. But when we eradicate malaria, the gain will not involve this loss. Because losses are relative to context, any generalization about the impossibility of overall improvements is dubious.</p>

        <div class="point" epub:type="subchapter">
            <h3 id="the-family-and-our-descendants">5 The Family and Our Descendants</h3>
            <p>Unlike various compulsory eugenic policies, genetic engineering need not involve any interference with decisions by couples to have children together, or with their decisions about how many children to have. And let us suppose that genetically engineered babies grow in the mother's womb in the normal way, so that her relationship to the child is not threatened in the way it might be if the laboratory or the hospital were substituted for the womb. The cruder threats to family relationships are eliminated.</p>
            <p>It may be suggested that there is a more subtle threat. Parents like to identify with their children. We are often pleased to see some of our own characteristics in our children. Perhaps this is partly a kind of vanity, and no doubt sometimes we project on to our children similarities that are not really there. But, when the similarities do exist, they help the parents and children to understand and sympathize with each other. If genetic engineering resulted in children fairly different from their parents, this might make their relationship have problems.</p>
            <p>There is something to this objection, but it is easy to exaggerate. Obviously, children who were like Midwich cuckoos, or comic-book Martians, would not be easy to identify with. But genetic engineering need not move in such sudden jerks. The changes would have to be detectable to be worth bringing about, but there seems no reason why large changes in appearance, or an unbridgeable psychological gulf, should<span class="page-break">35</span> be created in any one generation. We bring about environmental changes which make children different from their parents, as when the first generation of children in a remote place are given schooling and made literate. This may cause some problems in families, but it is not usually thought a decisive objection. It is not clear that genetically induced changes of similar magnitude are any more objectionable.</p>
            <p>A related objection concerns our attitude to our remoter descendants. We like to think of our descendants stretching on for many generations. Perhaps this is in part an immortality substitute. We hope they will to some extent be like us, and that, if they think of us, they will do so with sympathy and approval. Perhaps these hopes about the future of mankind are relatively unimportant to us. But, even if we mind about them a lot, they are unrealistic in the very long term. Genetic engineering would make our descendants less like us, but this would only speed up the natural rate of change. Natural mutations and selective pressures make it unlikely that in a few million years our descendants will be physically or mentally much like us. So what genetic engineering threatens here is probably doomed anyway.</p>

            <h3 id="cloning">6 Cloning</h3>
            <p>Cloning is reproduction of an organism by cell division. A cell-nucleus from the organism to be reproduced is transferred to an unfertilized egg whose own cell-nucleus has been removed. Where this is successful, the resulting organism has the same genetic make-up as the original one. If we develop techniques for cloning humans, should we use them? If we think of producing a single offspring by cloning, there seems to be only one, rather speculative, objection. Perhaps there would be psychological problems, because of the special position of being a cloned offspring. (Scientists sometimes talk of the benefits to physics of being able to clone a replica of Einstein. If scientific originality depends less on genes than this project assumes, these expectations would create obvious problems for the less talented Einstein-clone.) But, if these problems are minor or non-existent, the production of a single cloned person seems unobjectionable.</p>
            <p>When people are repelled by the thought of clones, they usually have in mind the creation of whole batches of people of identical composition.<span class="page-break">36</span></p>
            <p>This is unattractive because of the value we place on having a wide variety of different people. In an extreme case, where a town was entirely populated by one male clone and one female clone, there would be practical problems. {People might have problems telling who they were married to. And the police might find identification parades less useful.) But the practical drawbacks are not central. We feel our lives would be impoverished by the loss of variety. And our present degree of variety has genetic advantages. A very diverse gene pool makes it more likely that some of us will survive biological disasters such as the spread of some new and lethal disease.</p>
            <p>We might expect cloning to change our relationships. Bernard Williams (in a different context) discusses what it would be like to love someone just as an instance of a type rather than as an individual person. He says,</p>
            <blockquote>We can dimly see what this would be like. It would be like loving a work of art in some reproducible medium. One might start comparing, as it were, performances of the type: and wanting to be near the person one loved would be like wanting very much to hear some performance, even an indifferent one, of Figaro &ndash; just as one will go to the scratch provincial performance of Figaro rather than hear no Figaro at all, so one would see the very run-down Mary Smith who was in the locality, rather than see no Mary Smith at all.</blockquote><span class="footnote-anchor"></span><span class="footnote" data-num="7">7. 'Are Persons Bodies?'. In <em>Problems of the self</em>. Cambridge. 1973. p. 81. </span>
            <p>These engaging thoughts about this disturbing possibility might never be actualized, because of the extent to which a relationship between two people depends on a history of shared experiences, and of their responses to each other. Perhaps cloning will alter relationships less than we might first think. (I wonder what it is like now to love someone who has an identical twin?) And any changes of a disturbing kind might be matched by compensating advantages. Members of a clone might develop special bonds of closeness and empathy.</p>
            <p>It is hard to guess how far cloning would change relationships, or whether any changes would be on balance for better or worse. The central objections have to do with the narrowing of the gene-pool, and the impoverishing uniformity involved. These objections are so strong that any substantial use of cloning batches of people could only be justified by some very pressing reason, of a kind not now apparent.<span class="page-break">37</span></p>

            <h3 id="crossing-species-boundaries">7 Crossing Species Boundaries</h3>
            <p>Many people feel a revulsion at the thought of genetic engineering being used to produce creatures which would combine characteristics of more than one species, and feel this particularly strongly where one of the species in such a combination would be our own.</p>
            <p>One reason for the revulsion may be the thought that the creature would be an outcast, not accepted as a member by the species from which it had come. But this is not the central reason. That could be dealt with by producing enough of the new type for them to make their own community.</p>
            <p>More fundamental is the fear that inappropriate parts of different species could be combined. We think of a creature with a fair amount of human mentality unable to express much, because of the limitations of a body derived from a wolf or a cat. Perhaps we are influenced by stories like Kafka's <em>Metamorphosis</em>, where a man one day finds he has the body of an insect. This is a misleading way of thinking of what genetic mixing of species would be like, as a lot of the special horror of Kafka's story comes from the man having thoughts and feelings which depend on his having previously been an ordinary human. A better model of what inappropriate mixing might be like may be imprinting, where, for instance, young geese are given an early environment which gives them later a sexual orientation towards humans.</p>
            <p>It is likely that we would only mix species if the resulting animals were going to have qualities that we would find useful. This suggests the purpose would only be exploitation. But this does not distinguish the genetic mix from other animals that we rear for purposes of exploitation. It is objectionable where our treatment of animals means that they have less good lives than they could have, but exploitation is not worse because the breed is an artificial product. Perhaps the special unpleasantness of combining exploitation with genetic mixing is in the possibility that creatures might be partly human. We imagine someone breeding a slave species combining the passive subservience of domesticated animals with some human intellectual skills.</p>
            <p>The horror of the half-human slave species has two components. The first aspect of its awfulness is the probably unsatisfactory life of such creatures. It seems likely that the combination of such different genes would lead to psychological stresses and frustrations. And, if we suppose<span class="page-break">38</span> that genetic engineering has reached a level of precision where these conflicts can be eliminated, we may still feel, from our external perspective, that the life of these creatures is impoverished. The objection is not on grounds of misery or frustration, as these have been eliminated, but on grounds of possibilities that we can see have been lost: the possibilities in a fully human life. The objection is like that to some project of breeding contented mental defectives as slaves. They may be contented, and not miss lost aspects of life which they cannot understand. But we think it wrong to bring into the world people with such relatively impoverished lives when we could have brought normal people into the world instead.</p>
            <p>The question of how we can be justified in thinking one sort of life more worthwhile than another is a central issue in this book. This is its first appearance, and here I just assume that many readers share the above view about breeding contented mental defectives. Some theoretical issues underlying such judgements are discussed in the last part of the book. But, even if we are quite confident that contented creatures combining features of humans and of, say, cows have lives that are less worthwhile than fully human lives are, there is another problem. We say that, by adding some cow genes, we have produced sub-humans rather than humans. But someone might reply that, by adding some human genes, we have produced super-cows rather than cows. If the number of humans stays constant, and the population of ordinary cows declines as farmers choose to have super-cows instead, it is hard to see that the world has grown worse.</p>
            <p>Yet, even if a particular project of mixing genes from different species involves no suffering, and even if we are persuaded by the 'super-cow' argument that the project involves no loss in quality of life, we may still feel repelled. Our revulsion has a second component, more to do with our own psychological needs than with the interests of the creature produced. Mary Douglas, in her anthropological theorizing, has stressed the importance to us of the main categories we use in classifying the world, and the disturbance induced by things that straddle or blur the boundaries between them. One of her illustrations of this is the idea of dirt:</p>
            <blockquote>It is a relative idea. Shoes are not dirty in themselves, but it is dirty to place them on the dining-table; Is not dirty in itself, but it is dirty to leave cooking utensils in the bedroom, or bespattered on clothing; similarly, bathroom equipment in<span class="page-break">39</span> the drawing-room; clothing lying on chairs; outdoor things indoors; upstairs things downstairs: underclothing appearing where overclothes should be, and so on. In short, our pollution behaviour is the reaction which condemns any object or idea likely to confuse or contradict cherished classifications.</blockquote><span class="footnote-anchor"></span><span class="footnote" data-num="8">8. Purity and Danger, London, 1966, p. 48.</span>
            <p>She suggests that this point is relevant to the explanation of food taboos of the kind laid down in Leviticus, where some animals are thought unclean. Another example she gives of the importance of such boundaries applied to animals is in the outlook of the Lele:</p>
            <blockquote>Most of their cosmology and much of their social order is reflected in their animal categories. Certain animals and parts of animals are appropriate for men to eat, others for women, others for children, others for pregnant women. Others are regarded as totally inedible. One way or another the animals which they reject as unsuitable for human or female consumption turn out to be ambiguous according to their scheme of classification. Their animal taxonomy separates night from day animals: animals of the above (birds, squirrels and monkeys) from animals of the below: water animals and land animals. Those whose behaviour is ambiguous are treated as anomalies of one kind or another and arc struck off someone's diet sheet. For instance, flying squirrels are not unambiguously birds nor animals, and so they are avoided by discriminating adults.</blockquote><span class="footnote-anchor"></span><span class="footnote" data-num="9">9. Ibid, pp. 1967.</span>
            <p>When and how much people are disturbed by things anomalous in their system of classification is not an easy question. But, if we feel sympathetic to Mary Douglas's idea, its application to genetic mixing of the species will seem plausible. For the divisions between the species are the lines of our system of classifying animals, and disturbance at the thought of blurring them may be playing a part in our hostile response. And the division between our own species and others is even more important to our system of thought. Perhaps it was this, as well as religious belief, that motivated the resistance to Darwin.</p>
            <p>To the extent that our resistance to genetic mixing is caused by revulsion against anomalies, it is tempting to dismiss it. Perhaps it is no more capable of rational justification than the food taboos of the Lele, and is something we could give up without loss. Some people hate the thought of intermarriage between races, and those of us who do not have that revulsion do not feel we lack anything of value. The temptation to dismiss our resistance as an irrational taboo is one we should mainly yield to. But some qualifications are necessary.<span class="page-break">40</span></p>
            <p>It may not be easy to give up our feelings of revulsion. There seems little problem when we think in terms of other people giving up their food taboos. But, when we turn to our own, the psychological difficulty is clearer. If the most efficient meat production was the rearing of cats or rats for food, we might find our resistance hard to overcome. And the same might be true of our resistance to genetic mixing of species. We know rather little about how deep this kind of reaction goes, and should not assume that shedding taboos is without psychological cost. Another qualification has to do with the effects of making traditional category boundaries seem less important by blurring them. Our present practice is to act in quite different ways towards humans and towards members of other species. We exploit animals for our food and our research, treating them in ways we would not think of treating even the most subnormal human being if, instead of there being a clear gap between monkeys and ourselves, genetic mixing resulted in many individuals varying imperceptibly along the continuum between the two species, this might undermine our present belief in the moral importance of the distinction. If it did, the effects might go either way. There might be a beneficial reform in our attitudes towards members of other species. Or there might be a weakening of the prohibitions that now protect weaker or less intelligent humans from the treatment animals are subjected to. If the second possibility is a real danger, there is a strong case for resisting the blurring of this boundary.</p>

            <h3 id="risks-and-mistakes">8 Risks and Mistakes</h3>
            <p>Although mixing different species and cloning are often prominent in people's thoughts about genetic engineering, they are relatively marginal issues. This is partly because there may be no strong reasons in favour of either. Our purposes might be realized more readily by improvements to a single species, whether another or our own, or by the creation of quite new types of organism, than by mixing different species. And it is not clear what advantage cloning batches of people might have, to outweigh the drawbacks. This is not to be dogmatic that species mixing and cloning could never be useful, but to say that the likelihood of other techniques being much more prominent makes it a pity to become fixated on the issues raised by these ones. And some of the most serious objections<span class="page-break">41</span> to positive genetic engineering have wider application than to these rather special cases. One of these wider objections is that serious risks may be involved.</p>
            <p>Some of the risks are already part of the public debate because of current work on recombinant DNA. The danger is of producing harmful organisms that would escape from our control. The work obviously should take place, if at all, only with adequate safeguards against such a disaster. The problem is deciding what we should count as adequate safeguards. I have nothing to contribute to this problem here. If it can be dealt with satisfactorily, we will perhaps move on to genetic engineering of people. And this introduces another dimension of risk. We may produce unintended results, either because our techniques tum out to be less finely tuned than we thought, or because different characteristics are found to be genetically linked in unexpected ways.</p>
            <p>If we produce a group of people who turn out worse than expected, we will have to live with them. Perhaps we would aim for producing people who were especially imaginative and creative, and only too late find we had produced people who were also very violent and aggressive. This kind of mistake might not only be disastrous, but also very hard to 'correct' in subsequent generations. For when we suggested sterilization to the people we had produced, or else corrective genetic engineering for their offspring, we might find them hard to persuade. They might like the way they were, and reject, in characteristically violent fashion, our explanation that they were a mistake.</p>
            <p>The possibility of an irreversible disaster is a strong deterrent. It is enough to make some people thin k we should rule out genetic engineering altogether, and to make others think that, while negative engineering is perhaps acceptable, we should rule out positive engineering. The thought behind this second position is that the benefits from negative engineering are clearer, and that, because its aims are more modest, disastrous mistakes are less likely.</p>
            <p>The risk of disasters provides at least a reason for saying that, if we do adopt a policy of human genetic engineering, we ought to do so with extreme caution. We should alter genes only where we have strong reasons for thinking the risk of disaster is very small, and where the benefit is great enough to justify the risk. (The problems of deciding when this is so are familiar from the nuclear power debate.) This 'principle of caution' is less strong than one ruling out all positive engineering,<span class="page-break">42</span> and allows room for the possibility that the dangers may tum out to be very remote, or that greater risks of a different kind are involved in not using positive engineering. These possibilities correspond to one view of the facts in the nuclear power debate. Unless with genetic engineering we think we can already rule out such possibilities, the argument from risk provides more justification for the principle of caution than for the stronger ban on all positive engineering.</p>

        <div class="point" epub:type="subchapter">
            <h3 id="the-objections-so-far">9 The Objections So Far</h3>
            <p>It is a widely held view that positive genetic engineering should in principle be ruled out. This belief, when combined with the view that it is acceptable to use genetic engineering to remedy defects, depends upon a distinction that is not completely sharp. But, assuming that some such distinction can at least roughly be drawn, some of the arguments against any positive engineering have been criticized.</p>
            <p>The arguments designed to show that overall improvement is unlikely need not deter us. Some are difficulties for eugenic breeding policies, which need not apply to genetic engineering. Others appeal to a principle we need not believe in: that genetic gains will always be balanced by compensating losses.</p>
            <p>The need to protect family relationships creates a presumption that any genetic change should be brought about gradually. But this point, like other arguments for caution, should be placed in the context of the genetic changes which are taking place anyway, sometimes as the unintended results of policies of ours.</p>
            <p>The disadvantages of cloning batches of people create a presumption against that policy. Our resistance to crossing species boundaries may be largely irrational, though in the case of mixing human and other genes, there may be dangers in undermining our resistance. But the dominating reason for caution about adopting positive human genetic engineering, as well as for gradualness if we do adopt it, is the risk of some irreversible disaster. Even this risk has only been interpreted here as justifying a principle of caution rather than a total ban. Like all the objections considered so far, it is a matter of setting losses or risks against any possible benefits. Because all these objections have been of this kind, they are all, from the theoretical point of view, relatively<span class="page-break">43</span> clear. They are in some cases important, but most of them raise few deep issues not already present in debates on other possibly hazardous technology, or in debates on large scale social changes. The set of problems which raises deeper issues centres round the question: if we adopt positive genetic engineering, who is in a position to decide what future people should be like?<span class="page-break">44</span></p>

        </figure>
        <p>Some of the strongest objections to positive engineering are not about specialized applications or about risks. They are about the decisions involved. The central line of thought is that we should not start playing God by redesigning the human race. The suggestion is that there is no group (such as scientists, doctors, public officials, or politicians) who can be entrusted with decisions about what sort of people there should be. And it is also doubted whether we could have any adequate grounds for basing such decisions on one set of values rather than another.</p>
        <p>This chapter is about the 'playing God' objection: about the question 'Who decides?'. and about the values involved. I shall argue that these issues raise real problems, but that, contrary to what is often supposed, they do not add up to an overwhelming case against positive engineering.</p>
        <div class="point" epub:type="subchapter">
            <h3 id="not-playing-god">1 Not Playing God</h3>
            <p>Suppose we could use genetic engineering to raise the average IQ by fifteen points. (I mention, only to ignore, the boring objection that the average IQ is always by definition 100.) Should we do this? Objectors to positive engineering say we should not. This is not because the present average is preferable to a higher one. We do not think that. If it were naturally fifteen points higher, we ought to bring it down to the present level. The objection is to our playing God by deciding what the level should be.<span class="page-break">45</span></p>
            <p>On one view of the world, the objection is relatively straightforward. On this view, there really is a God, who has a plan for the world which will be disrupted if we stray outside the boundaries assigned to us. (It is <em>relatively</em> straightforward: there would still be the problem of knowing where the boundaries came. If genetic engineering disrupts the programme, how do we know that medicine and education do not?)</p>
            <p>The objection to playing God has a much wider appeal than to those who literally believe in a divine plan. But, outside such a context, it is unclear what the objection comes to. If we have a Darwinian view, according to which features of our nature have been selected for their contribution to gene survival, it is not blasphemous, or obviously disastrous, to start to control the process in the light of our own values. We may value other qualities in people, in preference to those which have been most conducive to gene survival.</p>
            <p>The prohibition on playing God is obscure. If it tells us not to interfere with natural selection at all, this rules out medicine, and most other environmental and social changes. If it only forbids interference with natural selection by the direct alteration of genes, this rules out negative as well as positive genetic engineering. If these interpretations are too restrictive, the ban on positive engineering seems to need some explanation. If we can make positive changes at the environmental level, and negative changes at the genetic level, why should we not make positive changes at the genetic level? What makes this policy, but not the others, objectionably God-like?</p>
            <p>Perhaps the most plausible reply to these questions rests on a general objection to any group of people trying to plan too closely what human life should be like. Even if it is bard to distinguish in principle between the use of genetic and environmental means, genetic changes are likely to differ in degree from most environmental ones. Genetic alterations may be more drastic or less reversible, and so they can be seen as the extreme case of an objectionably God-like policy by which some people set out to plan the lives of others.</p>
            <p>This objection can be reinforced by imagining the possible results of a programme of positive engineering, where the decisions about the desired improvements were taken by scientists. Judging by the literature written by scientists on this topic, great prominence would be given to intelligence. But can we be sure that enough weight would be given to other desirable qualities? And do things seem better if for scientists<span class="page-break">46</span> we substitute doctors, politicians or civil servants? Or some committee containing businessmen, trade unionists, academics, lawyers and a clergyman?</p>
            <p>What seems worrying here is the circumscribing of potential human development. The present genetic lottery throws up a vast range of characteristics, good and bad, in all sorts of combinations. The group of people controlling a positive engineering policy would inevitably have limited horizons, and we are right to worry that the limitations of their outlook might become the boundaries of human variety. The drawbacks would be Like those of town-planning or dog-breeding, but with more important consequences.</p>
            <p>When the objection to playing God is separated from the idea that intervening in this aspect of the natural world is a kind of blasphemy, it is a protest against a particular group of people, necessarily fallible and limited, taking decisions so important to our future. This protest may be on grounds of the bad consequences, such as loss of variety of people, that would come from the imaginative limits of those taking the decisions. Or it may be an expression of opposition to such concentration of power, perhaps with the thought 'What right have they to decide what kinds of people there should be?' Can these problems be side-stepped?</p>

            <h3 id="the-genetic-supermarket">2 The Genetic Supermarket</h3>
            <p>Robert Nozick is critical of the assumption that positive engineering has to involve any centralized decision about desirable qualities: 'Many biologists tend to think the problem is one of design, of specifying the best types of persons so that biologists can proceed to produce them. Thus they worry over what sort(s) of person there is to be and who will control this process. They do not tend to think, perhaps because it diminishes the importance of their role, of a system in which they run a "genetic supermarket", meeting the individual specifications (within certain moral limits) of prospective parents. Nor do they think of seeing what limited number of types of persons people's choices would converge upon, if indeed there would be any such convergence. This supermarket system has the great virtue that it involves no centralized decision fixing the future human type(s).'<span class="footnote-anchor"></span><span class="footnote" data-num="1">1. <em>Anarchy. State and Utopia</em>. New York. 1974. p. 315.</span><span class="page-break">47</span></p>
            <p>This idea of letting parents choose their children's characteristics is in many ways an improvement on decisions being taken by some centralized body. It seems less likely to reduce human variety, and could even increase it, if genetic engineering makes new combinations of characteristics available. (But we should be cautious here. Parental choice is not a guarantee of genetic variety, as the influence of fashion or of shared values might make for a small number of types on which choices would converge.)</p>
            <p>To those sympathetic to one kind of liberalism, Nozick's proposal will seem more attractive than centralized decisions. On this approach to politics, it is wrong for the authorities to institutionalize any religious or other outlook as the official one of the society. To a liberal of this kind, a good society is one which tolerates and encourages a wide diversity of ideals of the good life. Anyone with these sympathies will be suspicious of centralized decisions about what sort of people should form the next generation. But some parental decisions would be disturbing. If parents chose characteristics likely to make their children unhappy, or likely to reduce their abilities, we might feel that the children should be protected against this. (Imagine parents belonging to some extreme religious sect, who wanted their children to have a religious symbol as a physical mark on their face, and who wanted them to be unable to read, as a protection against their faith being corrupted.) Those of us who support restrictions protecting children from parental harm after birth (laws against cruelty, and compulsion on parents to allow their children to be educated and to have necessary medical treatment) are likely to support protecting children from being harmed by their parents' genetic choices. No doubt the boundaries here will be difficult to draw. We already find it difficult to strike a satisfactory balance between protection of children and parental freedom to choose the kind of upbringing their children should have. But it is hard to accept that society should set no limits to the genetic choices parents can make for their children. Nozick recognizes this when he says the genetic supermarket should meet the specifications of parents 'within certain moral limits'. So, if the supermarket came into existence, some centralized policy, even if only the restrictive one of ruling out certain choices harmful to the children, should exist. It would be a political decision where the limits should be set. There may also be a case for other centralized restrictions on parental choice, as well as those aimed at preventing harm to the individual<span class="page-break">48</span> people being designed. The genetic supermarket might have more oblique bad effects. An imbalance in the ratio between the sexes could result. Or parents might think their children would be more successful if they were more thrusting, competitive and selfish. If enough parents acted on this thought, other parents with different values might feel forced into making similar choices to prevent their own children being too greatly disadvantaged. Unregulated individual decisions could lead to shifts of this kind, with outcomes unwanted by most of those who contribute to them. If a majority favour a roughly equal ratio between the sexes, or a population of relatively uncompetitive people, they may feel justified in supporting restrictions on what parents can choose. (This is an application to the case of genetic engineering of a point familiar in other contexts, that unrestricted individual choices can add up to a total outcome which most people think worse than what would result from some regulation.) Nozick recognizes that there may be cases of this sort. He considers the case of avoiding a sexual imbalance and says that 'a government could require that genetic manipulation be carried on so as to fit a certain ratio'.<span class="footnote-anchor"></span><span class="footnote">2. op, cit .. p. 315.</span> He clearly prefers to avoid governmental intervention of this kind, and, while admitting that the desired result would be harder to obtain in a purely libertarian system, suggests possible strategies for doing so. He says: 'Either parents would subscribe to an information service monitoring the recent births and so know which sex was in shorter supply (and hence would be more in demand in later life), thus adjusting their activities, or interested individuals would contribute to a charity that offers bonuses to maintain the ratios, or the ratio would leave 1:1. with new family and social patterns developing.' The proposals for avoiding the sexual imbalance without central regulation are not reassuring. Information about likely prospects for marriage or sexual partnership might not be decisive for parents' choices. And, since those most likely to be 'interested individuals' would be in the age group being genetically engineered, it is not clear that the charity would be given donations adequate for its job.<span class="footnote-anchor"></span><span class="footnote">3. This kind or unworldly innocence is part or the engaging charm or Nozick's dotty and brilliant book.</span></p>
            <p>If the libertarian methods failed, we would have the choice between allowing a sexual imbalance or imposing some system of social regulation. Those who dislike central decisions favouring one sort of person over<span class="page-break">49</span> others might accept regulation here, on the grounds that neither sex is being given preference: the aim is rough equality of numbers. But what about the other sort of case, where the working of the genetic supermarket leads to a general change unwelcome to those who contribute to it? Can we defend regulation to prevent a shift towards a more selfish and competitive population as merely being the preservation of a certain ratio between characteristics? Or have we crossed the boundary, and allowed a centralized decision favouring some characteristics over others? The location of the boundary is obscure. One view would be that the sex-ratio case is acceptable because the desired ratio is equality of numbers. On another view, the acceptability derives from the fact that the present ratio is to be preserved. {In this second view, preserving altruism would be acceptable, so long as no attempt was made to raise the proportion of altruistic people in the population. But is <em>this</em> boundary an easy one to defend?)</p>
            <p>If positive genetic engineering does become a reality, we may be unable to avoid some of the decisions being taken at a social level. Or rather, we could avoid this, but only at what seems an unacceptable cost, either to the particular people being designed, or to their generation as a whole. And, even if the social decisions are only restrictive, it is implausible to claim that they are all quite free of any taint of preference for some characteristics over others. But, although this suggests that we should not be doctrinaire in our support of the liberal view, it does not show that the view has to be abandoned altogether. We may still think that social decisions in favour of one type of person rather than another should be few, even if the consequences of excluding them altogether are unacceptable. A genetic supermarket, modified by some central regulation, may still be better than a system of purely central decisions. The liberal value is not obliterated because it may sometimes be compromised for the sake of other things we care about.</p>

            <p>The genetic supermarket provides a partial answer to the objection about the limited outlook of those who would take the decisions. The choices need not be concentrated in the hands of a small number of people. The genetic supermarket should not operate in a completely unregulated way,<span class="page-break">50</span> so and so some centralized decisions would have to be taken about the restrictions that should be imposed. One system that would answer many of the anxieties about centralized decision-making would be to limit the power of the decision-makers to one of veto. They would then only check departures from the natural genetic lottery, and so the power to bring about changes would not be given to them, but spread through the whole population of potential parents. Let us call this combination of parental initiative and central veto a 'mixed system'. If positive genetic engineering does come about, we can imagine the argument between supporters of a mixed system and supporters of other decision-making systems being central to the political theory of the twenty-first century, parallel to the place occupied in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries by the debate over control of the economy.<span class="footnote-anchor"></span><span class="footnote" data-num="4">4. Decision-taking by a central committee (perhaps of a dozen elderly men) can be thought of as a 'Russian' model. The genetic supermarket (perhaps with genotypes being sold by TV commercials) can be thought of as an 'American' model. The mixed system may appeal to Western European social democrats.</span></p>
            <p>My own sympathies are with the view that, if positive genetic engineering is introduced, this mixed system is in general likely to be the best one for taking decisions. I do not want to argue for an absolutely inviolable commitment to this, as it could be that some centralized decision for genetic change was the only way of securing a huge benefit or avoiding a great catastrophe. But, subject to this reservation, the dangers of concentrating the decision-making create a strong presumption in favour of a mixed system rather than one in which initiatives come from the centre. And, if a mixed system was introduced, there would have to be a great deal of political argument over what kinds of restrictions on the supermarket should be imposed. Twenty-first-century elections may be about issues rather deeper than economics.</p>
            <p>If this mixed system eliminates the anxiety about genetic changes being introduced by a few powerful people with limited horizons, there is a more general unease which it does not remove. May not the limitations of one generation of parents also prove disastrous? And, underlying this. Is the problem of what values parents should appeal to in making their choices. How can we be confident that it is better for one sort of person to be born than another?<span class="page-break">51</span></p>

            <h3 id="values">4 Values</h3>
            <p>The dangers of such decisions, even spread through all prospective parents, seem to me very real. We are swayed by fashion. We do not know the limitations of our own outlook. There are human qualities whose value we may not appreciate. A generation of parents might opt heavily for their children having physical or intellectual abilities and skills. We might leave out a sense of humour. Or we might not notice how important to us is some other quality, such as emotional warmth. So we might not be disturbed in advance by the possible impact of the genetic changes on such a quality. And, without really wanting to do so, we might stumble into producing people with a deep coldness. This possibility seems one of the worst imaginable. It is just one of the many horrors that could be blundered into by our lack of foresight in operating the mixed system. Because such disasters are a real danger, there is a case against positive genetic engineering, even when the changes do not result from centralized decisions. But this case, resting as it does on the risk of disaster, supports a principle of caution rather than a total ban. We have to ask the question whether there are benefits sufficiently great and sufficiently probable to outweigh the risks.</p>
            <p>But perhaps the deepest resistance, even to a mixed system, is not based on risks, but on a more general problem about values. Could the parents ever be justified in choosing, according to some set of values, to create one sort of person rather than another?</p>
            <p>Is it sometimes better for us to create one sort of person rather than another? We say 'yes' when it is a question of eliminating genetic defects. And we say 'yes' if we think that encouraging some qualities rather than others should be an aim of the upbringing and education we give our children. Any inclination to say 'no' in the context of positive genetic engineering must lay great stress on the two relevant boundaries. The positive - negative boundary is needed to mark off the supposedly unacceptable positive policies from the acceptable elimination of defects. And the genes - environment boundary is needed to mark off positive engineering from acceptable positive aims of educational policies. But it is not clear that confidence in the importance of these boundaries is justified.</p>
            <p>The positive-negative boundary may seem a way of avoiding objectionably God-like decisions, on the basis of our own values, as to what sort<span class="page-break">52</span> of people there should be. Saving someone from spina bifida is a lot less controversial than deciding he shall be a good athlete. But the distinction, clear in some cases, is less sharp in others. With emotional states or intellectual functioning, there is an element of convention in where the boundaries of normality are drawn. And, apart from this, there is the problem of explaining why the positive-negative boundary is so much more important with genetic intervention than with environmental methods. We act environmentally to influence people in ways that go far beyond the elimination of medical defects. Homes and schools would be impoverished by attempting to restrict their influence on children to the mere prevention of physical and mental disorder. And if we are right here to cross the positive-negative boundary, encouraging children to ask questions, or to be generous and imaginative, why should crossing the same boundary for the same reasons be ruled out absolutely when the means are genetic?</p>
            <p>It may be said that the genes-environment boundary is Important because environmentally created changes can be reversed in a way that genetically based characteristics can not. But this perhaps underrates the permanence of the effects of upbringing. It may be that the difference is at best a matter of degree. And it is also hard to believe that irreversibility can be our main objection to crossing the genes-environment boundary. In bringing up our children, we try to encourage kindness and generosity. Would we really stop doing this if we were so effective that cruelty and meanness became impossible for them? It is not clear that our concern to develop their autonomy requires keeping open all possibilities, at whatever cost to our other values. Yet there remains an unease about positive policies of moulding people in one direction rather than another, however much they are already incorporated in our child-rearing, and however reluctant we would be to abandon them altogether. And the unease is intensified when the methods are genetic, perhaps because the changes are likely to be less reversible, and perhaps because they may be more extreme. It may be said that we do not see the human race from the God-like perspective that seems to be required for making these decisions. We have our values, but perhaps we ought to be modest about them. E. 0. Wilson's speculation that intuitions about values have their basis in the limbic system might be right. If so, perhaps genetic engineering could alter the limbic system, and so alter the values by which people judge these issues. And this<span class="page-break">53</span> raises the question of what basis we have for saying that genetic change~> are improvements.</p>
            <p>The sceptical case has been strongly stated by Bernard Williams. He talks of a difficulty about the basis of values on which these supposed improvements would be introduced. One would have to take the kind of standpoint in which one regarded as self-evident to oneself what the future of the human race should be, presuppose that you knew what the human race was here for, and take all the steps you could to make it reach that ideal goal. But it is not at all clear where one is supposed to gel that knowledge or information from.' Talk of 'knowledge' and 'information' sets the standard rather high, requiring the proponents of positive genetic engineering to have solved problems about objectivity in ethics which we do not expect people arguing other cases to have solved. But the point can be freed from this implication by being put as a question: on what basis can we decide between bringing into existence different types of people? If we take decisions of this sort, we cannot but be guided by our own values (which would perhaps have been different had our limbic systems been different). But this' is a feature of any moral or political decision. And it is not obvious that we are the best possible people in terms of our own values. People more generous, braver and less conformist than ourselves may be people we can recognize would be better than us. This need not commit us to some utopian blueprint about what the human race is for, but could be a matter of piecemeal genetic engineering. We take a view about what sort of people we prefer when we make decisions about schooling, without claiming to know what the human race is here for. And, as with educational decisions, decentralized choices at the genetic stage could lead to variety rather than uniformity. There is, of course, a general problem about the basis of the values we bring to any decision. But it is questionable how far this is an argument against intervention to change what people are like, whether the means are genetic or environmental. Why should we assume that opting for the genetic status quo involves less commitment to a world view than opting for a change? And, if we are sure that some genetic changes would be for the worse, and so want to restrict the genetic supermarket, is<span class="footnote-anchor"></span><span class="footnote" data-num="4">5. 'Genetics and Moral Responsibility', In A. Clow (ed.), <cite>Morals and Medicine</cite>. London. 1970.</span><span class="page-break">54</span> it really plausible to say we have no basis for thinking some changes would be for the better? The scepticism seems unjustifiably selective. U positive genetic engineering is to be justified, there must be benefits to outweigh the risks. And the benefits have to be even greater if centralized social decisions are taken, not merely to filter out certain parental initiatives, but positively to encourage the development of some characteristics. I have argued that there should be a presumption in favour of decentralized choices, which are more likely to preserve or increase variety than decisions taken from the narrow viewpoint of the members of some central body. But this is a presumption rather than an absolute ban on any central initiative. The chance of securing some great benefit, or of avoiding some great catastrophe, might justify overriding the presumption. It is hard to imagine being persuaded of the rightness of such a policy if adopted undemocratically or if imposed by coercion. But, even with a democratically chosen policy, using only persuasion or incentives, there is still the liberal resistance to government endorsement of some types of people as more desirable than others.</p>

            <h3 id="changing-human-nature">5 Changing Human Nature</h3>
            <p>Positive genetic engineering raises two issues. Could we be justified in trying to change human nature? And, if so, is genetic change an acceptable method? Most of us feel resistance to genetic engineering, and these two questions are often blurred together in our thinking. One aim of the discussion has been to separate the different sources of our resistance. Another has been to try to isolate the justifiable doubts. These have to do with risks of disasters, or with the drawbacks of imposed, centralized decisions. They need not justify total rejection of positive engineering. The risks are good reasons for extreme caution. The other drawbacks are good reasons for decentralized decisions, and for resisting positive genetic engineering in authoritarian societies. But these good reasons are quite separable from any opposition in principle to changing human nature.</p>
            <p>The idea of 'human nature' is a vague one, whose boundaries are not easy to draw. And, given our history, the idea that we must preserve all the characteristics that are natural to us is not obvious without argument. Some deep changes in human nature may only be possible<span class="page-break">55</span> if we do accept positive genetic engineering. It is true that our nature is not determined entirely by our genes, but they do set limits to the sorts of people we can be. And the evolutionary competition to survive has set limits to the sorts of genes we have. Perhaps changes in society will transform our nature. But there is the pessimistic thought that perhaps they will not. Or, if they do, the resulting better people may lose to unreconstructed people in the evolutionary struggle. On either of these pessimistic views, to renounce positive genetic engineering would be to renounce any hope of fundamental improvement in what we are like. And we cannot yet be sure that these pessimistic views are both false.</p>
            <p>Given the risks that positive genetic engineering is likely to involve, many people will think that we should reject it, even if that means putting up with human nature as it is. And many others will think that, quite apart from risks and dangers, we ought not to tamper with our nature. I have some sympathy with the first view. The decision involves balancing risks and gains, and perhaps the dangers will outweigh the benefits. We can only tell when the details are clearer than they are now, both about the genetic techniques and about the sort of society that is in existence at the time.</p>
            <p>It is less easy to sympathize with opposition to the principle of changing our nature. Preserving the human race as it is will seem an acceptable option to all those who can watch the news on television and feel satisfied with the world. It will appeal to those who can talk to their children about the history of the twentieth century without wishing they could leave some things out. When, in the rest of this book, the case for and against various changes is considered, the fact that they are changes will be treated as no objection at all.</p>
