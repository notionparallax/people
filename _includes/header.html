    <h1>What's going on here?</h1>
    <p>I really enjoyed this book when I read it about 8 years ago. I wanted to read it again but it's out of print.</p>
    <p>You can go to <a href="http://www.jonathanglover.co.uk/">Jonathan Glover</a>'s website to see more of his work.</p>
    <p>This is an attempt to make it into an electronic version, eventually into an eBook. You can read it on a small screen quite happily, or add it to a reader like <a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a>. If you look at it on a big screen it'll break the text up into pages and put the scanned page that the text came from next to the HTML text.</p>
    <p>The formatting is a bit grim in places. I've tried to make it look as close to the printing as possible to make it easy to spot discrepancies. Hopefully soon it'll look beautiful once I'm happy with the accuracy of the text.</p>
    <p>If you spot a spot an error then go to the <a href="https://github.com/notionparallax/people">GitHub repository where this all lives</a> and submit an issue or a pull request.</p>
    <p>To make it easier to spot the differences between the digital text and the scan of the book read it in crusty to make it nicer to read, go flashy:</p>
